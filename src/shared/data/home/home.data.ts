				TITLE: 'GROWING UP IN BELLE EPOQUE',
				INTRODUCTION: [
					"Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People in creative professions have a special way of perceiving the world and defining their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His Yesterday's World, which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is also an account of an entire generation that saw their world crumble; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written by an exile on another continent, sent to his publisher in February 1942 – two days before his suicide.

						'"… If I try to find some useful phrase to sum up the time of my childhood and youth before the First World War, I hope I can put it most succinctly by calling it the Golden Age of Security… But for all the sobriety of people’s concept of life at the time, there was a dangerous and overweening pride in this touching belief that they could fence in their existence, leaving no gaps at all. People no more believed in the possibility of barbaric relapses, such as wars between the nations of Europe, than they believed in ghosts and witches; our fathers were doggedly convinced of the infallibly binding power of tolerance and conciliation. They honestly thought gradually to flow into a sense of common humanity, so that peace and security, the greatest of goods, would come to all mankind…". [^quote1]',

						'It always seems to ordinary people that the life of monarchs resembles a vividly illustrated fairy tale. The biography of Princess Charlotte of Luxembourg comforts this myth. Her life story is like a drama, but with a happy ending. On the one hand, it was the life of an ordinary person, in which sadness and joy, happiness and suffering alternated. It was the life of a woman whose father died early and was raised by her mother – together with her five sisters. At the same time, her life was regulated by her special status, which imposed certain responsibilities and limited her personal freedom.'

						"The country was ruled by her grandfather Adolphe I. After his death in 1905, the princesses' father inherited the Luxembourg throne. Grand Duke Wilhelm was worried that in the absence of a male heir, his family might lose not only power but also their home. Therefore, he managed to agree with the government on changes to the Nassau-Weilburg family charter. This meant that the Luxembourg princesses would have a preemptive right to the throne of the Grand Duchy in order of birth. It is worth noting that the Duke's worries were not in vain. Unexpectedly, a contender of Russian descent, Count Georg von Merenberg, a descendant of the Grand Duke's brother Adolf by a morganatic marriage with the daughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, declared his right to the throne. However, after a heated debate, the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies approved a law changing the succession to the throne in favor of princesses.

His wife, Regent Maria-Anna, took care of her seriously ill husband herself, so Charlotte and her sisters' childhood was not very happy. For example, the family was forced to move frequently because most of the existing residences were unsuitable for a comfortable life and their father's health. The lives of the princesses were strictly regulated and controlled, accompanied by various restrictions. Parliament, the government, church officials, and the press were closely monitoring all events in the life of the monarch’s family, taking into account his health. Meanwhile, the government and the general public were dissatisfied with the monarch's long absence from the country. Researchers noted the 'alienation' of the ruling family, which eventually had critical consequences for the dynasty. [^history_uni_lu_research]"

[^bezhuk_womens_stories_2015_p369]. This detail shows the equality of Stepan Fedak's wife not only in the home but also in public affairs. It is not surprising that their children were brought up as “conscious” Ukrainians, taking an active part in the political life of their land.

There was also a watchman who guarded the house and locked the heavy metal “brama” (gate) at night, making the house seem like a reliable fortress.  [^kuzmowycz_this_and_that_2000_p14].

In particular, Sofia's older sister Olena recalled how her parents discussed the resonant event that took place on April 12, 1908: the assassination of the Polish governor of Galicia, Andrzej Potocki, by a student of Lviv University, Myroslav Sichynskyi. Sichynskyi was a relative of Maria Fedak, and she “as the greatest ‘revolutionary’ of us all was outraged by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky's condemnation of this act”.

At the same time, her husband seemed to approve of Sheptytsky's “political tactic.” Stepan Fedak “by his nature was inclined to live in harmony with everyone and reconcile everyone rather than to fight with opponents of other views.” [^savchuk_fedak_thesis_2019_p130]"

In winter, they skated on a frozen pond, and in summer they went swimming and played tennis. Vacations were spent either in the Ukrainian Carpathians (Kosiv, Yaremche, Vorokhta) or abroad (Belgium, Switzerland). For the then 20-year-old Olena, the prewar year remained in her memories as “one big leisure time: dances, balls, home ‘fife’ (tea parties), theater, concerts, parties...” [^baran_sheparovych_memoirs_2014_p119]."

			CHAPTER2: {
				TITLE: 'WORLD WAR I',
				INTRODUCTION: [
					"For Ukraine, the First World War was a tragedy. Because there was no common state, Ukrainians were forced to fight against each other in the armies of the warring parties. Millions of Ukrainians died for someone else's interests, and these interests were hypothetical even for the leaders of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires, who ruled over Ukrainian lands, at the time. At the same time, it is important to know that in the course of this war (1918), Ukraine briefly gained independence, an important historical experience that fueled later resentment and a quest for revenge. The national liberation struggle in Ukraine during the Great War gave rise to future fighters for the independence of the Ukrainian people. [^plokhy_gates_of_europe_2016] Meanwhile, Luxembourg also experienced serious upheaval. Contrary to international law, which was supposed to ensure Luxembourg's 'eternal' neutrality, the country was occupied by German troops. The German government ignored diplomatic protests. Officially, the occupation of Luxembourg was not considered hostile: the state and local administration remained intact, and political life continued. However, the German military authorities constantly interfered in the governance of the state. Thousands of Luxembourgers volunteered for the French Foreign Legion. [^hdl_10993_48662] The paradox was that the then German Emperor Wilhelm II was an uncle to the Luxembourg princesses. Grand Duchess Maria-Adelaide may have tried to preserve the country's independence by meeting with Wilhelm II in Luxembourg during his visit to the Western Front. On the advice of the Minister of State, an unofficial secret meeting was arranged, but the information was leaked to French newspapers. [^weitz_charlotte_von_luxemburg_1990_p212_213] The Grand Duchess's actions seriously damaged Luxembourg's reputation in France. In addition, she tried to impose her political views which led to many cabinet reshuffles and profound resentment of the liberal elites. After a short-lived Republic, suppressed by the French occupation army, Marie-Adelaide abdicated in favor of her younger sister, Charlotte."

The Bourbon-Parma family lived in Schwarzau Castle in Austria after the Duke of Parma lost his throne in 1859.

This institution was characterized by strict discipline.  He continued his education in Brixen (Tyrol) and at a Jesuit school in Vienna. He received his high school diploma at a school in Mödling, Lower Austria. He then studied in England at Stonyhurst College to prepare for admission to Oxford. But the war changed all his plans. Felix graduated from the Vienna Military Academy before joining the Austrian army with his brother René. He served as an officer in the Austrian 15th Dragoon Regiment, participating mainly in battles in Italy. The war divided his family. Two of his brothers served in the Belgian army, at a time when Belgium and Austria were at war. Sources indicate that Felix distinguished himself with particular bravery at the front, including saving the life of his brother-in-law, the Austrian Emperor Charles.

His adoptive parents took care of his health, paying for his long and complicated treatment, as well as his education. Andriy Melnyk first studied at elementary schools in Sambir and Drohobych.

It was there that Melnyk met Yevhen Konovalets, whose friendship had a dramatic impact on his future life.

At that time, the events of the November Uprising (the uprising of Ukrainian national forces to establish the Ukrainian state) -were unfolding in Lviv.

					"The situation of Ukrainians was complicated by the fact that the central and eastern Ukrainian lands were part of Soviet Russia and experienced all the consequences of the totalitarian Bolshevik regime. While the western Ukrainian territories, divided between Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, had a different experience. This solution to the 'Ukrainian question'  had severe consequences for the Ukrainian people. While for most European countries, this short period meant a return to peaceful life, it remains in the collective memory of Ukrainians as a period characterized by repression and genocide by the Soviet regime, and by the Polish government's harsh chauvinistic assimilation policy, which was accompanied by deportations of the population and oppression of the Ukrainian language and church. A similar anti-Ukrainian policy, albeit in a somewhat milder form, was pursued by the governments of Romania and Czechoslovakia, respectively, in relation to Bukovyna and Zakarpattia. Such a rigid and sometimes brutal policy made Ukrainians perceive the new governments as occupying powers and provoked active resistance. Residents of the western part of Ukraine resisted especially hard fiercely, using both legal and underground methods of struggle. This included terror as strategy. Throughout the stateless period, the interests of Ukrainians in the world were represented by Ukrainian emigrants."

After the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne, the country was gripped by revolutionary fever. The workers' and peasants' council, supported by the crowd, demanded the overthrow of the monarchy and the proclamation of a republic. The newly formed French League also wanted to establish a republic in Luxembourg under the protection of France. Belgium put forward its own territorial claims.

Andriy Melnyk had joined when completing his education in Vienna, and from the beginning of 1937 he was the organization's treasurer. In his will, Colonel Konovalets appointed Colonel Melnyk, as his successor as head of the organization in the event of his death.

				TITLE: 'WORLD WAR II',
				INTRODUCTION: [
					'When the Wehrmacht troops occupied Luxembourg on May 10, 1940, the Grand Duchess and members of the government fled to France, and after its surrender they created a government in exile, first in London and then in Montreal. From exile, Grand Duchess Charlotte called on citizens to disobey the new regime. During the war many Luxembourgers joined the French Resistance or formed underground movements in occupied Luxembourg.In October 1941 a census was organized by the Gauleiter to prove that the population’s citizenship, ethnicity and mother tongue were German. The resistance encouraged people to reply “three times Luxembourgish” and the census was cancelled.[^source31]',

					'Unlike the occupation during the First World War, Nazi Germany pursued a policy of total assimilation, banning the French language, dissolving political parties and abolishing the Luxembourg state. Although Luxembourg was not formally annexed to the Reich, young men were drafted into the Wehrmacht in August 1942; this fuelled resistance and led to strikes in industry and schools. In September 1944 Allied forces liberated Luxembourg and the government was able to return from exile. During the Ardennes offensive the north of the country was recaptured by German troops and was finally liberated only in January 1945. The policy of denying the very existence of Luxembourgers as a nation ultimately strengthened national identity.[^source32]',

					'During the Second World War Ukraine once again found itself in the epicentre of hostilities. Its territory, already divided among four neighbouring states, was also coveted by fascist Hungary and Germany, while the Soviet regime aimed to expand its borders by annexing western Ukraine. Ukrainians were again forced into a fratricidal war, fighting each other in the armies of opposing sides.',

					'In the Soviet army mostly inhabitants of eastern, central and southern Ukraine fought; one in five soldiers of the Polish army at the beginning of the war was Ukrainian; the advancing Nazi army even had a separate Ukrainian military unit. [^source33] At the same time, the Second World War triggered a new wave of national liberation movement of Ukrainian patriots, whose goal was to create an independent state. Also, emigrant centers of nationalist forces were intensively preparing for a new stage of struggle. ',
					'Desperate for support from the former Entente powers, which had ignored the “Ukrainian question” after the end of World War I, nationalist organizations sought support from reactionary circles of the Nazi government in Germany. Despite the similarity of their ideologies, the German Nazis and Ukrainian nationalists had different goals, but tried to use each other to their advantage. However, this cooperation, as time has shown, was short-lived and led, among other things, to the split of the OUN in 1940.',

					'The leaders of both factions, Andriy Melnyk and Stepan Bandera, were imprisoned by the Nazis and hundreds of OUN members were executed. Nazi occupation of Ukraine brought the Holocaust, blurring the line between resistance and collaboration. As historian Serhii Plokhy observed, “Ukraine under German occupation became a large-scale model of a concentration camp. As in the camps, the line between resistance and cooperation, the role of victim and complicity in the regime is crimes became blurred and invisible. Everyone made a personal choice, and the survivors had to live with their decisions after the war, some in harmony and some in pangs of conscience. But almost everyone suffered from guilt for surviving.” [^source34]'

						"According to some sources, international events on the eve of the war prompted Prince Felix to plan the possible emigration of the Grand Ducal family. He established the first contacts with U.S. President FD Roosevelt and prepared the establishment of a Luxembourg mission in Washington. When the Wehrmacht violated Luxembourg's neutrality and invaded the country on May 10, 1940, the Grand Duchess, accompanied by her family and government, left for France. The Nazis offered her to stay in the country, promising to preserve her status, but she refused. Millions of refugees in today's world can relate to and understand the phrase Charlotte used to answer: 'My heart says yes, but my mind says no.' [^source35]"

The Grand Duchess stayed in London for a while, rejoining her family in October of that year. Obviously, this difficult decision of the Duchess was dictated by concern for the safety of her own family, for the reputation of the monarchy, and the lessons learned during the reign of Maria Adelaide.

						'Nevertheless, throughout her exile, Charlotte maintained her duties as head of state as much as possible. In 1941, she visited Luxembourgish emigrant groups and associations in the United States. Over the next two years, she traveled the United States on so-called "Goodwill Tours." In 1943, she settled in London, from where she supported her people by speaking on the BBC radio. Witnesses to the events of the time claimed that in this way the Grand Duchess helped to strengthen the patriotic feelings of the Luxembourgers and their cohesion in opposing the invaders. The Grand Duchess Charlotte began each of her speeches with the words "Léif Lëtzebuerger" ("Dear Luxembourgers"), a phrase that later became the title of a documentary film by filmmaker Ray Tostevin about her five years in exile.

From November 1942, Prince Felix served in the British Army's Northern Command. The future Grand Duke Jean personally participated in the Allied landings in Normandy. The Grand Duchess also returned home on April 14, 1945 - before the war officially ended. The grand-ducal family was greeted with much enthusiasm, as shown in an archival footage. [^source38]"

						'One of the former Sich Riflemen, a centurion in the UPR army, Yevhen Malaniuk, who had known Melnyk since the Ukrainian National Liberation Revolution, recalled how in the summer of 1941 he received a phone call from colonel Melnyk in his Warsaw apartment: "It has begun. Mr. Centurion, your place is in Kyiv." However, Malaniuk did not respond to the call. During the twenty years of emigration, his life had changed.',

						'He had a family, earned his living by writing, and did not want to return to Kyiv with a foreign army whose goals he did not share. At the same time, he later noted in his memoirs that "...when Andriy Melnyk became the head of a revolutionary organization after the murder of Yevhen Konovalets, it was not because he felt like a revolutionary or a politician. In my opinion, the decisive factor here was a purely military sense of duty: to replace a fallen comrade and former commander... And if it were not for the regiment.

						'According to Oleksandr Skrypnyk, a researcher of the history of Ukrainian intelligence, as early as 1923, the leaders of the UVO (i.e., Y. Konovalets, A. Melnyk, and others) signed a cooperation agreement with the leaders of German counterintelligence. Members of the UVO conducted intelligence activities on the territory of Poland in favor of the Reichswehr, and in return, the organization received monthly financial assistance and assistance in training covert warfare personnel.',
						'As a result, an effective and extensive intelligence network was created, which was eventually inherited by the OUN. The OUN leadership, headed by A. Melnyk, had a special intelligence group for relations with the German special services. O. Skrypnyk believes that "intelligence activities were considered by the OUN leaders as one of the important prerequisites for the armed overthrow of the occupation authorities and the restoration of the Ukrainian state.

						"Melnyk's personal attitude toward the Nazis remains unknown. He could not have been unaware of the discussion that took place at the Berlin conference of the OUN in 1933, a few months after they came to power in Germany. At the conference, Yevhen Konovalets spoke out against establishing ties with the National Socialists, citing their negative attitude toward the peoples of Eastern Europe. He argued his conclusions sharply but convincingly, quoting Hitler's book 'Mein Kampf.' [^source42]",

						"However, despite Konovalets' outspoken position, Melnyk faced difficult challenges during the war and decided on a different course. The German Nazis were the only ones who agreed to arm Ukrainians, and this was the most important thing for the OUN at the time, which was preparing for a new stage of the struggle for an independent Ukraine. At the end of July 1941, on the order of Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller, Melnyk and his wife were placed under house arrest in Berlin."

					PARAGRAPH_6: [
						"In January 1942, along with other well-known Ukrainian activists, Melnyk signed a memorandum to Adolf Hitler demanding that he stop his destructive policy on the territory of Ukraine. The OUN leader probably foresaw the possible consequences of active political activity that contradicted the Nazis' plans. Therefore, for security reasons, the Melnyk/Fedak couple secretly left Berlin in January 1944 and settled in Vienna. But later they were arrested for the second time and transported to a remote area in the Austrian Alps. There, in the town of Hirschegg  (Kleinwalsertal), various political prisoners were held under house arrest in the Hotel Ifen.",

						"The most famous among them was the former French ambassador to Berlin, André François-Poncet. He had a hard time with his imprisonment, entrusting his feelings to his diary, which was rescued from the guards and partially published after the war. In the conditions of isolation from the world, various prohibitions and restrictions, the only entertainment for the prisoners was walking, reading books sent by relatives from the outside, and communicating with each other. Therefore, the new arrivals were surrounded by excessive attention. In particular, on Friday, March 3, 1944. Poncet shared with his diary his impression of meeting a Ukrainian colonel and his wife who arrived that day: 'This Melnyk is graceful, noble, very polite, and well-mannered; his wife, small and black-haired, with sharp features and a keen look of lively eyes from under her glasses.'"

						"Because of his refusal to meet the Nazi's demands, Andriy and Sofia Melnyk  were transferred to the Nazi concentration camp Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen (north of Berlin) on July 27, 1944. There was a separate room for 'special' prisoners called Zellenbau, where Hitler's 'personal enemies,' high-ranking officials, and activists of the Ukrainian national liberation movement were held.",

						"During this difficult period in the life of the Melnyk/Fedak couple, a story happened that deserves special attention. One of the declassified documents of the CIA archive from 1960 reports information that at Sachsenhausen, Melnyk saved the life of the brother of the Luxembourg prince consort Felix Bourbon-Parma. The dispatch  mentions the provision of any assistance to A. Melnyk and his family in the event of a 'threat to their personal safety'."
					],
					PARAGRAPH_8: [
						"Perhaps that is why, after the release from the concentration camp, Melnyk's family found refuge in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with the assistance of Prince Felix. According to psychologist Viktor Frankl, who had been interned himself, this was not uncommon: 'We don't like to talk about our experiences. Those who were in the camps don't need to explain anything, and others will not understand either what we felt then or what we feel now.' [^source43]",

						'Andriy and Sofia Melnyk also never mentioned the rescue of a member of the royal family. This can be explained by a conscious and concerted decision by all involved to hide this fact from the public for various reasons. On the other hand, this event could have been completely invented by Prince Felix of Luxembourg specifically for the American intelligence services as a justification for his support of the Melnyk family. If we assume that the rescue actually took place, then we can only hope that new documents will eventually appear that will confirm or refute this historical mystery. "Res porro tractatur" (Latin for "the case is not yet closed")...',

						"Ironically, by imprisoning Melnyk's family, the Nazis saved the life of the leader of the Ukrainian nationalists. The Sectoral State Archive of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine has published a collection of documents of the GPU-NKVD-MGB-KGB of the Ukrainian SSR on the liquidation of prominent figures of the Ukrainian national liberation movement. The book contains a number of documents confirming the sabotage work of the Soviet special services among the OUN. Among the declassified materials are those that confirm the development of plans by the Soviet special services for the physical destruction of Andriy Melnyk. For example, one of the references states: '...in order to decompose the Ukrainian nationalist underground... and to organize special measures to eliminate Andriy Melnyk... in the near future, a special group 'Vulcan' will be sent abroad to Berlin [^source44]",

						"On October 17, 1944, the Nazis released the leaders of Ukrainian organizations, including members of the OUN. This became possible due to a change in their strategy of using Ukrainian nationalists to continue the war in Europe. A. Melnyk was authorized to negotiate with representatives of the Nazi government on the establishment of the Ukrainian National Committee to represent Ukrainians in Germany. Sofia described further changes in their lives over time as follows: '...the general tendency at the time was to get out of Germany as soon as possible in order to contact our emigration in America and Canada. Onatsky was the first to do so, to Rome and Andrievsky to Belgium. Through Andrievsky, my husband sent a letter (because the post office was not yet running) to Prince Felix of Luxembourg, whom he knew from his visits to the metropolitan's hunting grounds. From Bad Godesberg we went to the Luxembourg consul in Wiesbaden, and later to Cologne, where we received permission to enter Luxembourg.' [^source45]",

						"Confirmation of the latter fact can be found in one of Andriy Melnyk's letters to Dmytro Andrievsky, written on July 3, 1945, in Bad Kissingen. Among other things, he stated that '...there is not a word from Felix; I am afraid that the letter did not reach him.' [^source46]"

						'Indeed, the process of waiting for a permit to enter Luxembourg for the Melnyk/Fedak couple lasted more than a year. For some time, there was correspondence between officials of various organizations regarding the granting of such a permit. Then their identities were checked by the Public Security Service[Pr1]  of the Grand Duchy. The information that this service managed to collect contains contradictory data about A. Melnyk, but also confirms some facts from the memories of his entourage. In particular, according to one of the documents, A. Melnyk is described as: "A colonel of the American army, an engineer by profession, he was a Belarusian officer, and before the war he was a large landowner in Poland... Members of the Grand Ducal House visited his estate, and Prince Felix is also a good friend of his, and he invited Melnyk to visit him." On the basis of this document, the Melnyk couple was to be granted an entry visa and a residence permit for a period of 3 months. [^source47]',

						"Documents in the Melnyk/Fedak family file, which is kept in the National Archives of Luxembourg, show that on June 7, 1946, Andriy and Sofia answered a questionnaire at the Grand Duchy's immigration police.

						"The police were particularly interested in the couple's means to sustain their livelihood. In response, Melnyk explained that he had some savings and planned to work as a journalist.

And that during the short period of his stay in the Duchy, 'it was not possible to find out anything about his business'."
					],
					PARAGRAPH_13: [
						"It can be concluded here that the Luxembourg Security Service may have had some information about Melnyk's true activities, but the police failed to find conclusive evidence. So, apparently, Prince Felix of Luxembourg helped the Melnyk family to obtain asylum  in the Grand Duchy. It would be interesting to find the letter that was so eagerly awaited in Bad Kissingen. It would shed more light on the relationship between the two former Austrian army officers, who met in the interwar period while hunting in Galicia and whose relationship probably went beyond a casual acquaintance."

						"Both women received regular financial assistance from the organization's special fund. [^source64] In 1975. Sofia was naturalized, i.e. became a citizen of Luxembourg. She is registered in the national registry under her maiden name Fedak. [^source65]",

						"In the center of the photo is the house at: 36, rue Guillaume Schneider (in the district of Limpertsberg), where Sofia lived after her husband's death. She moved there in December 1973 from another address: 42, Av. Berchem, in the Howald suburb of the capital."

						"However, it has not yet been possible to find out when the couple settled there. The registration book of the Luxembourg City Hall contains some inaccuracies and has gaps in the records of their moves. Indirectly confirming their residence at this address is the fact that t Maria Sichynska and later Andriy Melnyk were buried at the cemetery of Bonnevoie – close to Howald. Official sources say that Sofia lived at 36, rue Guillaume Schneider until December 12, 1989. From December 13, 1989 until her death on July 29, 1990 she was registered at 2, rue Englebert Neveu, where she lived. [^source66] The last address of her registration  is the Hospice de Hamm, one of the geriatric institutions in Luxembourg  under the care of the Red Cross. According to the register, she spent only six months there, but Sofia was seriously ill for the last 8 years of her life, 'the disease deprived her of the ability to move and act freely.'. [^source64]",

						"It is possible that she was living in the Hospice much longer. In 1987  Olga Kuzmovych wrote an essay reflecting on loneliness in old age and may have referred to Sofia : '...who knows today how the wife of a well-known political leader feels in a retirement home? Who tries to ease the fate of a lonely old woman who once helped others so much'  [^source67] Another of her essays describes a scene in a geriatric home after the Christmas holidays. The nurses, who speak only German, are discussing a romantic story involving a resident of room 216, who has just received a visitor. The girls whisper among themselves, saying that this woman is a foreigner, from Ukraine.",

						"She understands German but does not speak it. She was brought from the hospital several years ago in a semi-conscious state. All this time, she has been lying still and only whispering quietly. She has no family here. She is rarely visited by anyone. Only one elegant gray-haired man comes every week, brings flowers and stays for half an hour at the patient's bedside, holding her hand... [^source68] It is known that Olga Kuzmovych described scenes from real life and her reflections on them in her short essays and feuilletons. Thus, the story mentioned above may be directly related to her aunt Sofia.According to oral testimonies, Sofia was buried next to her husband, but for some unknown reason, her name is missing from the monument."

						"Perhaps this was her wish. But it is also possible to explain this fact by the absence of Sofia's close relatives who could have perpetuated her memory. Information about the burial place of anyone is not available to outsiders. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg protects the personal data of its citizens even after their death. In any case, Sofia Fedak/Melnyk has earned the right to keep her name in the collective memory of Ukrainians."

				"Despite all the difficulties, the project's protagonists, like their peoples, withstood all the trials of the twentieth century. The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has developed into a powerful state with significant economic capital and political influence. Luxembourg became a founding member of the Benelux Union, European Union (EU), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN), and the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO), which confirms its key role in international relations.",

				'While not denying their complex history, Luxembourgers tend to defend their own identity. This may be exemplified by the language policy: the laws used to be bilingual (German-French) but are now solely in French; German remains an official administrative language too, but the “national language” is Luxembourgish.[^source69]',

				'In addition, many residents of the Grand Duchy are fluent in English, which is particularly popular in the capital. In the south of the country, where the Portuguese community is well represented, Portuguese has gained additional popularity. Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS) is sometimes used on official flyers and many other languages can be heard in the streets. At the same time, Luxembourgish dominates in pre-school and primary education as a “language of inclusion”. To obtain citizenship, applicants must pass an exam in Luxembourgish. This is the uniqueness of Luxembourg, which defines itself as “open and cosmopolitan”.[^source70]',

				'Since 1991 Ukraine has been developing as an independent state. The process has been complicated by the legacy of totalitarianism. While Ukrainians were re-examining distorted pages of their history, Russia — unwilling to accept the collapse of the USSR — launched hybrid attacks and in 2014 moved to annex Ukrainian territory openly. Today Ukrainians again defend their independence, identity and future. The defence of the Ukrainian language, long subject to Russification, is especially acute — yet this time Ukraine is backed by democracies worldwide under the UN Charter right of self-defence.[^source71]',

				'The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is, within the EU, at the forefront of this coalition.[^source72] Luxembourg’s motto is “Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinn” (“We wish to remain as we are”). It is precisely this right to remain oneself that the Ukrainian people are defending today.'
