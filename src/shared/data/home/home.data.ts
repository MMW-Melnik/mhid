				'In the interwar period, the territory of Ukraine was divided between 4 neighboring states. \nThe situation of Ukrainians was complicated by the fact that the central and eastern Ukrainian lands were part of Soviet Russia and experienced all the consequences of the totalitarian Bolshevik regime. \nThe western Ukrainian territories, divided between Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, had a different experience. \n\nSuch an ill-considered solution by world politicians to the "Ukrainian question," which was relevant to international relations at the time, had severe consequences for the Ukrainian people. \nFor most European countries, this short period of return to peaceful life was imprinted in the collective memory of Ukrainians by repression and genocide by the Soviet regime and by the Polish government\'s harsh chauvinistic assimilation policy, which was accompanied by deportations of the population and attacks on the Ukrainian language and church. \nA similar anti-Ukrainian policy, albeit in a somewhat milder form, was pursued by the governments of Romania and Czechoslovakia, respectively, in relation to Bukovina and Transcarpathia (Zakarpattia). \n\nIt is quite understandable that such a rigid and sometimes brutal policy made Ukrainians perceive the new government as an occupying power and provoked active resistance. \nIn particular, the residents of the western part of Ukraine opposed it strongly, using both legal and underground methods of struggle, including terror. \n\nThroughout the stateless period, the interests of Ukrainians in the world were represented by the Ukrainian diaspora. \nThe main flow of political emigration occurred in the early 1920s. \nResearchers claim that "in 1921 the number of Ukrainian immigrants in Western European countries reached almost 100 thousand people." [^source26] \n\nA significant part of the emigrants were members of the national liberation movement who did not want to accept defeat and continued to fight for Ukraine\'s independence. \nAmong the political emigrants in Vienna, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was created in 1929 and was headed by Yevhen Konovalets. \n\nFounded as an underground patriotic movement, the OUN quickly became a powerful force. \nIn 1933, it was legalized in Ukraine as a public organization. \nThe OUN led the Ukrainian resistance movement, first to the Polish, then to the Soviet, and later to the Nazi occupation authorities. \nThe organization operated mainly in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia, as well as in exile. \n\nAiming to establish an independent, united Ukrainian state, the organization relied on right-wing radical ideology and practice, which made it similar to similar political movements in Europe at the time. \n\nIt should be noted that the liberation movement in Ukraine was not homogeneous either. \nThere were various underground groups and organizations that, for various reasons, could not unite their efforts to achieve a single goal and were often at odds with each other. \n\nThe end of the war did not bring peace to Luxembourg either. \nAfter the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne, the country was gripped by revolutionary fever. \nThe workers\' and peasants\' council, supported by the crowd, demanded the overthrow of the monarchy and the proclamation of a republic. \n\nThe newly formed French League also wanted to establish a republic in Luxembourg under the protection of French sovereignty. \nBelgium put forward its own territorial claims. \nThe fate of the dynasty hung in the balance. \n\nAt this difficult time, the Grand Duchess proposed a referendum in which the people would choose the form of government. \nIt should be noted that Maria-Adelaide was characterized by a special "mystical state of mind" from childhood, and in her youth she decided that she would never marry and that "Lottie should rule" [^source27]. \n\nTherefore, she did not hold on to power and decided to abdicate in favor of her sister. \n\nThe short but eventful and tragically completed biography of Grand Duchess Maria Adelaide is thoroughly reflected in the work of Dr. Josiane Weber. \nHer research, based on historical sources, balances the imbalance of the Grand Duchess\'s political role and her importance in the history of Luxembourg [^source28]. \n\nA summary of the research results is presented in the researcher\'s lecture (in German). \n[^source29].',

				'Princess Charlotte became the head of state on January 15, 1919. However, gaining power was not easy. She had to fight for the throne. \n\nThe diplomatic situation threatened Charlotte with the loss of power and the state with the loss of independence. Difficult negotiations with the French government resulted in an agreement to grant Charlotte the duchy on the condition that she marries Felix, who held the title of French Bourbon. Thus, it can be stated that the title of Prince Felix saved the Duchy from losing its independence. \n\nThe referendum ensured internal stability. On September 28, 1919, almost 80% of the population of Luxembourg voted in favor of preserving the monarchy headed by the Grand Duchess Charlotte. \n\nAt the same time, a constitution was adopted that declared the nation sovereign and clearly regulated the powers of the monarch. It is worth noting that the monarchy was saved by women, who were granted the right to vote for the first time on the eve of the referendum. Until that time, the female population of the Duchy had no influence on political life, but they had always unofficially supported the "princesses of Berg Castle," sympathizing with them and criticizing government officials. [^source30] \n\nThe former princess\'s personal life was also full of surprises. In particular, the vicissitudes of the marriage of the Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma deserve special attention. \n\nIt is clear that their engagement and wedding were the subject of increased public attention. This is confirmed by numerous archival publications and photographs. However, the peculiarity of the status of monarchs is that public interest in their private lives is not limited to chronological timeframes. \n\nFrom the memoirs of the American Papal Privy Counselor (Chamberlain) [^source31] Francis Augustus MacNutt, it became known that this marriage was concluded by proxy and out of the public eye on March 24, 1919, in Switzerland at the Wartegg Castle. \n\nIf we take into account the civil wedding ceremony that took place on the morning of November 6th of the same year in the Grand Ducal Palace of Luxembourg, it turns out that Charlotte married three times to the same man. The details of Charlotte and Felix\'s first (secret) wedding ceremony became known over time from eyewitness accounts, as did the reasons for it. \n\nPrince Felix could not come to Luxembourg, but he had documents that allowed him to marry. One of the witnesses was the Austrian Emperor Charles (Felix\'s brother-in-law). The bride was represented by her sister Maria Adelheid. Perhaps such secrets were due to the peculiarities of marriage between relatives. \n\nThis required special permission from the Pope, which Prince Felix managed to obtain. Difficulties also arose in Charlotte\'s homeland. The Luxembourgers were wary of the future prince, who had fought in an enemy coalition. The public was also concerned about the presence of feelings between the newlyweds. By the way, this question still interests researchers of the Grand Ducal family. [^source32] \n\nHowever, the young couple overcame all obstacles. Obviously, they were helped by influential relatives, friends, and officials interested in establishing stability. It was during this relatively calm interwar period that the couple had six children: Jean, Elizabeth, Marie-Adelaide, Marie-Gabrielle, Charles, and Alix. \n\nThe whole country celebrated the birth of their first child, the heir to the throne. In response to the congratulations, Charlotte said a phrase that became a catchphrase: "Ich dien" ("I serve"). [^source33] \n\nIt is worth noting that by giving birth to a son and choosing a common name for him, the Grand Duchess won the "battle" with the opponents of the monarchy, significantly strengthening the throne. Prince Jean became the first male heir to the throne born on Luxembourg\'s soil. In traditional societies, such things have always been of great importance and had important political consequences. \n\nThe dynastic issue became irrelevant, and the enemies of the Grand Ducal House were pacified. However, the happy life was overshadowed by a new war.',

				'The Riga Peace Treaty of 1921 recognized Poland\'s right to Eastern Galicia. This ill-considered decision of the Entente countries, aggravated by various types of discrimination by the restored Polish state, caused active resistance among Western Ukrainians. \n\nThe Polish authorities were perceived as occupiers, so they tried to get rid of them by any means necessary, using both legal and underground methods of struggle that included terror. This situation arose quite naturally. \n\nThe participants of the national liberation struggle who survived the hell of war, refusing to accept the defeat of their idea, tried to take revenge on those who were lucky enough to be in the victorious camp. Later, after realizing that there were no prospects for continuing the struggle, most of its participants left their homeland. \n\nA typical example of a Ukrainian of this era was Stepan Fedak, Sofia\'s brother, who joined the Ukrainian Insurgent Army at the age of 14 and fought in the Ukrainian Galician Army. Fedak was a member of the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), created by Yevhen Konovalets, and became famous for his assassination attempt of the head of the Polish state, Józef Piłsudski, in September 1921. \n\nA Polish court sentenced the young man to six years in prison, but he was released in 1924 and left the country. It is known that after this arrest, Stepan\'s mother, the calm "Mamunka" (as Maria Fedak was affectionately called by her family), quietly but firmly stated after a nighttime search of the house: "I am proud that it was my son who fulfilled this attentat." [^source34] \n\nThis position of a woman who approved of her son\'s terrorist attack reflects the mood of the majority of society. At the same time, Stepan\'s actions had unpleasant consequences for other family members. In particular, his father, Stepan Fedak (senior), made every effort to reach an understanding with the new government and reconcile the opponents. \n\nAccording to his contemporaries, he belonged to the conservative wing of Ukrainian politicians who hoped to achieve the desired result through negotiations, and was "more inclined to live in harmony with everyone and reconcile everyone than to fight with opponents of other views." [^source35] \n\nAt the same time, Dr. Fedak\'s words that "Poles and Ukrainians are people, and people can find common ground" [^source36] did not find support among young people of that time. This fact proves the differences in political views between representatives of different generations, which has been observed more than once in the public life of Ukrainians. \n\nAfter the attack, Dr. Fedak was arrested and spent 2 months in prison. His eldest daughter Olena recalled that "the whole Fedak family felt the consequences of the atentat." [^source37] \n\nIn particular, her husband, Lev Sheparovych, lost his job, they were forced to leave Lviv and moved to Germany for several years. During this difficult period for the family, Sofia studied at the Trade Academy in Vienna. After graduating in 1923, she worked at the Audit Union of Ukrainian Cooperatives in Lviv. From 1924, she was the bride of Andriy Melnyk. In the same year, he was sentenced by the Polish authorities to four years in prison for underground pro-Ukrainian activities. \n\nSofia went to the prison with packages to her fiancé every day for four years. It is not known for certain where the young couple met. Perhaps it happened on a train to Vienna, where they both received higher education and often traveled from home to study. This simple way of meeting was quite common among Ukrainian students. \n\nIt is also likely that Andriy Melnyk was introduced to the Fedak family, as well as Metropolitan Sheptytsky, by a well-known Ukrainian politician and public figure, Yevhen Olesnytskyi, who was Sofia\'s mother\'s uncle. Olesnytsky began to take care of Andriy from the time he studied at the Stryi Gymnasium. It is also known that it was thanks to Andriy Melnyk that Yevhen Konovalets met and later married Olena Fedak. \n\nAs the leader of an underground pro-Ukrainian organization (UVO), it was dangerous for Konovalets to remain in Ukraine. In December 1922, his wife and he emigrated to the West. They lived in exile in various European countries until the end of their lives, and Yevhen Konovalets never stopped searching for new methods of fighting for Ukraine\'s independence. \n\nAfter the end of their imprisonment, Andriy and Sofia were able to marry. The wedding took place on February 28, 1929, in the chapel of the Theological Seminary in Lviv. The couple had no children. Andriy Melnyk did not like to show off his personal family life and forbade his supporters to write about it. \n\nPerhaps this was the result of the torture he suffered in Russian captivity and the Polish prison. Melnyk later recalled his time in the Polish prison: "they beat me so much that it reached the League of Nations" [^source38] \n\nLawyer S. Fedak was involved in this publicity. In September 1925, he participated in the trial of a case of beating prisoners in a Lviv prison, where his son-in-law, a member of the UVO, A. Melnyk, was also held at the time. The lawyer ensured that the matter was considered by the Polish Sejm and that a note of protest was sent to the League of Nations, as well as that the horrific incident was widely covered in the domestic and foreign press. \n\nSofia and Andriy wanted to develop their family in their native Galicia. Sofia continued her work at the Audit Union and, together with her mother and sisters, initiated the creation of the Ukrainian Society of Women with Higher Education, which promoted the ideas of Ukrainian feminism. \n\nDespite the intense military and revolutionary life, Colonel Melnyk managed to complete his education in Vienna and receive his diploma. After the war, he began working as a forestry engineer in the estates of the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. These forests were famous far beyond the borders of Galicia. \n\nIt is known that at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries European aristocrats came to the Carpathians to hunt deer. In particular, Ukrainian archives contain references and photographs of Archduke Rudolf of Habsburg-Lorraine, Archduke Miguel of Braganza, and Archduchess Maria Theresa, daughter of the King of Portugal, hunting in Zakarpattia (Transcarpathia). This tradition continued after the war. \n\nMelnyk, who had a university degree and spoke foreign languages, met "high" guests with whom he could easily communicate. The memoirs of one of Melnyk\'s future political associates reveal an interesting detail, possibly heard from the colonel himself, about his acquaintance with Prince Felix, the Consort of Luxembourg. \n\n"Felix Bourbon-Parma, the brother of the Emperor\'s wife Zita, and thus a Habsburg relative, served in Przemysl. From the garrison he knew Ukrainians and the Ukrainian problem. As a relative of the Habsburgs and having memories of his youth in Galicia, he often came to Lviv and to Berehynia Forest for hunting. It was here that he initiated the acquaintance and friendship with Mr. Melnyk. That is why Colonel Melnyk was able to settle in Luxembourg so easily after the war ended." [^source39] \n\nMeanwhile, Sofia\'s family faced new challenges. On January 6, 1937, her father, Stepan Fedak, suddenly died. A year before his death, he had prepared a will, according to which his wife, Maria Sichynsky, was appointed the "universal heiress" of all the family\'s property. \n\nThe lawyer appointed his daughter Sofia as the second main heir, provided that "she would not keep the property for herself, but would give it to those in her family who would need it when they needed it." [^source40] \n\nMaria Fedak endured her husband\'s death with great fortitude, but told her family that "I will not have any holidays because of my grandfather\'s death." [^source41] \n\nAs the newspaper Dilo wrote, "...a grand memorial service on January 9, 1937, with the participation of 25 clergymen and citizens blocked the movement of the main artery of Lviv and ended with the burial of S. Fedak in Lychakiv without speeches, wreaths, or flowers, in view of the last will of the deceased" [^source42]. \n\nIn May 1938, Yevhen Konovalets was assassinated in Rotterdam by a Soviet secret service agent. Since February 1929, he had been the head of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which was proclaimed in Vienna as an underground movement to unite pro-Ukrainian groups that had been scattered after the war. \n\nAt first, Andriy Melnyk was the executor of its special tasks, and from the beginning of 1937 he began to act as the organization\'s treasurer. In his will for the OUN, Colonel Konovalets appointed Colonel Melnyk, whom he trusted the most, as his successor as head of the organization in the event of his death. So the Melnyks had to take on this heavy responsibility. \n\nIn September 1938, they left for Berlin and never returned to their homeland. \n\nIn general, it can be summarized that this short period of relatively peaceful and tranquil life was marked by happy moments, as well as serious shocks and heavy losses for Olena Fedak\'s family. Her niece, who was born in late 1917 and spent a lot of time under the care of her grandmother due to her parents\' constant employment, later recalled: "My childhood in the Fedak family was neither cheerful nor simple... It was constantly associated with some kind of danger, cowards, arrests, escapes abroad, and political trials in which our family members were also defendants, and my grandfather, Dr. Stepan Fedak, was the defense attorney..."
