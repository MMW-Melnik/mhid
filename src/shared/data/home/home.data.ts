						'"... If I try ti find some useful phrase to sum up the time of my childhood and youth before the First World War, I hope I can put it most succinctly by  calling it the Colden Age of Security… But for all the sobriety of people`s concept of life at the time, there was a dangerous and overweening pride in this touching belief that they could fence in their existence, leaving no gaps at all. People no more believed in the possibility of barbaric relapses, such as wars between the nations of Europe, than they believed in ghosts and witches; our fathers were doggedly convinced of the infallibly binding power of tolerance and conciliation. They honestly thought gradually flow into a sense of common humanity, so that peace and security, the greatest of goods, would come to all mankind. ..."'

				INTRODUCTION: [
					'Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People in creative professions have a special way of perceiving the world and defining their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His Yesterdays World, which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is also an account of an entire generation that saw their world crumble; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written by an exile on another continent, sent to his published in February 1942 – two days before his suicide [Stefan Zweig. The World of Yesterday: Memoirs of a European. / Translated from the German by Anthea Bell. Pushkin Press Classics, London, 2009, 474 p.] .'

						'It always seems to ordinary people that the life of monarchs resembles a vividly illustrated fairy tale. The biography of Princess Charlotte of Luxembourg comforts this myth. Her life story is like a drama, but with a happy ending. On the one hand, it was the life of an ordinary person, in which sadness and joy, happiness and suffering alternated. It was the life of a woman whose father died early and was raised by her mother – together with her five sisters. At the same time, her life was regulated by her special status, which imposed certain responsibilities and limited her personal freedom. The Nassau dynasty was one of the oldest European noble families with great wealth and possessions. It was in this family that Princess Charlotte was born on January 23, 1896. She was the second of six daughters in the family of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Luxembourg and his wife Princess Maria Anna of Portugal of the deposed Braganza dynasty. '

						"The country was ruled by her grandfather Adolphe I. After his death in 1905, the princesses' father inherited the Luxembourg throne. Grand Duke Wilhelm was worried that in the absence of a male heir, his family might lose not only power but also their home. Therefore, he managed to agree with the government on changes to the Nassau-Weilburg family charter. This meant that the Luxembourg princesses would have a preemptive right to the throne of the Grand Duchy in order of birth. It is worth noting that the Duke's worries were not in vain. Unexpectedly, a contender of Russian descent, Count Georg von Merenberg, a descendant of the Grand Duke's brother Adolf by a morganatic marriage with the daughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, declared his right to the throne. However, after a heated debate, the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies approved a law changing the succession to the throne in favor of princesses. [Paul Lafontaine. Unsere Dynastie: die Ursprünge der Nassauer und die Herrschaft der Nassau-Weilburger im Grossherzogtum Luxemburg (1890-1990), Sankt-Paulus-Druckerei, 1990, p. 78.] Meanwhile, Count von Merenberg managed to have his claims silenced with a substantial annual pension. Grand Duke William IV was seriously ill from the moment he inherited the throne until the end of his life. His wife, Regent Maria-Anna, took care of her seriously ill husband herself, so Charlotte and her sisters' childhood was not very happy. For example, the family was forced to move frequently because most of the existing residences were unsuitable for a comfortable life and their father's health. The lives of the princesses were strictly regulated and controlled, accompanied by various restrictions. Parliament, the government, church officials, and the press were closely monitoring all events in the life of the monarch’s family, taking into account his health. Meanwhile, the government and the general public were dissatisfied with the monarch's long absence from the country. Researchers noted the 'alienation' of the ruling family, which eventually had critical consequences for the dynasty.[https://history.uni.lu/research-luxembourg-4d/]"

						"Princesses Mary Adelaide and Charlotte began their representative duties early on, given their difficult family circumstances. At her mother's request, Charlotte accompanied her sister everywhere, preparing to take over the monarch's duties if necessary. The sisters attracted attention by their opposites. Mary Adelaide was characterized by restraint, shyness, and piety. Charlotte, on the other hand, was cheerful and open. The German ambassador to Luxembourg, Count Schwerin described Charlotte in his report: 'The princess is as gifted as her older sister, but fortunately does not suffer from such embarrassment. She makes every effort to fulfill her official duties. But she feels much more comfortable in a private circle, where her lively, cheerful temperament comes through. Everyone praises her for her special, cordial kindness... this friendliness is the main feature of her character, and her very elegant appearance is in perfect harmony with it...'. [Josiane Weber. Großherzogin Marie Adelheid von Luxemburg. Eine politische Biografie (1912-1919), Éditions Guy Binsfeld, Luxemburg, 2019, S. 94] According to her biographers, Princess Mary Adelaide was not ready for the role of Grand Duchess. First of all, because she was too young and inexperienced when she lost her father and inherited the throne. At the same time, Charlotte, being close to her sister, gained valuable experience that helped her in the future. [Josiane Weber. Großherzogin Marie Adelheid von Luxemburg. Eine politische Biographie (1912-1919), S. 75-81, 96-99]"

						"In contrast, the childhood of the other protagonist of our project, Sofia Fedak, was calm and carefree. She was born in Lviv (at that time part of Austria-Hungary) on October 30, 1901 as third of eight children.  Her father, Stepan Fedak, was a prominent Lviv jurist, lawyer, and one of the richest Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia. Some contemporary Ukrainian researchers call him “one of the then oligarchs of Austria-Hungary” [Bogdan Savchuk. Public Activity of Stepan Fedak (1861-1937): PhD thesis: 07.00.01 - History of Ukraine / V. Stefanyk Precarpathian National University. Ivano-Frankivsk, 2019. 276 p.]. His eldest daughter jokingly called herself “the daughter of a wealthy Lviv patrician” [Zoya Baran, “Olena Sheparovych's Memoirs as a Source for the History of Lviv in the First Third of the Twentieth Century”, Lwów: miasto - spoіeczeсstwo - kultura 9. 2014. p. 119]. Being a strong and even authoritarian man in any matters related to his professional interests, Stepan Fedak left the house and upbringing of his children entirely to his wife Maria Fedak-Sichynska, who was the daughter of a Greek Catholic priest, Father Lukian Sichynskіy, a cousin of one of the most famous Ukrainian politicians, Oleksandr Barvinskіy. Maria’s mother, Natalia Brylynska, was the sister of the famous lawyer Yevhen Olesnytskіy."

						"Maria Fedak-Sichynska was active in the women's educational movement in Galicia. According to the historian Olga Bezhuk, “Mrs. Maria, a small woman, always calm, unspoken, kept the house on Sykstuska Street in Lviv in exemplary order with a strong hand and took care of the decent upbringing of all eight children. And the children were brought up as conscious Ukrainians, participating in the political life of their land...” [Olga Bezhuk. Women's stories of S. Fedak's family // Scientific Bulletin of the Lviv National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology named after SZ Gzycki. Vol. 17, No. 4 (64), 2015, p. 368]. Maria was one of the first to focus on the role of women in society. According to archival data, Maria Fedak had the right to participate (together with her husband) in the election of deputies to the Lviv City Council for the period from 1913-1914. [Olga Bezhuk. Women's stories of S. Fedak's family // Scientific Bulletin of the Lviv National University of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology named after SZ Gzycki. Vol. 17, №No. 4 (64), 2015, p. 369]. This detail shows the equality of Stepan Fedak's wife not only in the home but also in public affairs. It is not surprising that their children were brought up as “conscious” Ukrainians, taking an active part in the political life of their land. There are two memoirs written by members of the Fedak family: Sophia’s oldest sister Olena and her niece Olga Kuzmowycz. The latter described the traditions of the Fedak family in an extremely vivid way as she had spent her childhood years in her grandparents' home. She recalled that in the courtyard of the Fedak family home there was a separate room for “mademoiselle”, a governess who taught the children German and French. There was also a watchman who guarded the house and locked the heavy metal “brama” (gate) at night, making the house seem like a reliable fortress.  [Olga Kuzmowycz. This and That. Collected Short Stories and Essays, New York, 2000, p. 14]. Her memoirs reveal a whole world of a wealthy Lviv family with detailed descriptions of everyday life, traditions, and customs. Particularly touching are her memories of Christmas, which was celebrated in the Fedak family with great solemnity, observing the traditional rite."

						"The example of the Fedak family illustrates the impact of global political events on the everyday life of Galician Ukrainians. In particular, Sofia's older sister Olena recalled how her parents discussed the resonant event that took place on April 12, 1908: the assassination of the Polish governor of Galicia, Andrzej Potocki, by a student of Lviv University, Myroslav Sichynskyi. Sichynskyi was a relative of Maria Fedak, and she “as the greatest ‘revolutionary’ of us all was outraged by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky's condemnation of this act”. [Zoya Baran., “Olena Sheparovych's Memoirs as a Source for the History of Lviv in the First Third of the Twentieth Century”. Lwów: miasto - społeczeństwo - kultura, Vol. 9, Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu Pedagogicznego, Kraków, 2014, p. 119]. This example demonstrates the high level of tension in Ukrainian society at the time, if an educated woman from a traditional patriarchal family, a civic volunteer who was widely involved in charity work, actually approved of a terrorist attack, and expected a similar reaction from the metropolitan of the Greek Catholic Church. At the same time, her husband seemed to approve of Sheptytsky's “political tactic.” Stepan Fedak “by his nature was inclined to live in harmony with everyone and reconcile everyone rather than to fight with opponents of other views.” [Bogdan Savchuk. Public Activity of Stepan Fedak (1861-1937): Candidate of Historical Sciences (07.00.01 - History of Ukraine) / V. Stefanyk Precarpathian National University, Ivano-Frankivsk, 2019, p. 130] In addition, Olena Fedak described in detail the leisure activities of her parents' family. The children attended all the children's parties in the city, concerts and performances in Ukrainian and Polish theaters. In winter, they skated on a frozen pond, and in summer they went swimming and played tennis. Vacations were spent either in the Ukrainian Carpathians (Kosiv, Yaremche, Vorokhta) or abroad (Belgium, Switzerland). For the then 20-year-old Olena, the prewar year remained in her memories as “one big leisure time: dances, balls, home ‘fife’ (tea parties), theater, concerts, parties...” [Zoya Baran. “Olena Sheparovych's Memoirs as a Source for the History of Lviv in the First Third of the Twentieth Century”. Lwów: miasto - społeczeństwo - kultura, Vol. 9, Wydawnictwo Naukowe Uniwersytetu Pedagogicznego, Kraków, 2014, p. 119]."
