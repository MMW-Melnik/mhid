			title: 'LATE NINETEENTH - EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. A PREMONITION OF WAR',
			text: "Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People of creative professions perceive the world in a special way, and determine their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His “Yesterday's World,” which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is rather a biography of an entire generation that had to survive two world wars; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written while in exile on another continent [^source1][^source2]"

			title: 'WORLD WAR II ',
			quote:
				'“Before the First World War, the Austrian monarchy was characterised by a sense of stability and reliability, where rights were fixed and duties were regulated. People believed that the world was on the way to a better future, where wars and conflicts would gradually disappear, giving way to peace and security.”',

			text: 'In the interwar period, the territory of Ukraine was divided between 4 neighboring states. The situation of Ukrainians was complicated by the fact that the central and eastern Ukrainian lands were part of Soviet Russia and experienced all the consequences of the totalitarian Bolshevik regime. The western Ukrainian territories, divided between Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, had a different experience. Such an ill-considered solution by world politicians to the "Ukrainian question", which was relevant to international relations at the time, had severe consequences for the Ukrainian people. For most European countries, this short period of return to peaceful life was imprinted in the collective memory of Ukrainians by repression and genocide by the Soviet regime, and by the Polish government\'s harsh chauvinistic assimilation policy, which was accompanied by deportations of the population and attacks on the Ukrainian language and church. A similar anti-Ukrainian policy, albeit in a somewhat milder form, was pursued by the governments of Romania and Czechoslovakia, respectively, in relation to Bukovina and Transcarpathia (Zakarpattia). It is quite understandable that such a rigid and sometimes brutal policy made Ukrainians perceive the new government as an occupying power and provoked active resistance. In particular, the residents of the western part of Ukraine had opposed it strongly, using both legal and underground methods of struggle, including terror.Throughout the stateless period, the interests of Ukrainians in the world were represented by the Ukrainian diaspora. The main flow of political emigration occurred in the early 1920s. Researchers claim that "in 1921 the number of Ukrainian immigrants in Western European countries reached almost 100 thousand people." [^source26]. A significant part of the emigrants were members of the national liberation movement who did not want to accept defeat and continued to fight for Ukraine\'s independence. Among the political emigrants in Vienna, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was created in 1929 and was headed by Yevhen Konovalets. Founded as an underground patriotic movement, the OUN quickly became a powerful force. In 1933, it was legalized in Ukraine as a public organization. The OUN led the Ukrainian resistance movement, first to the Polish, then to the Soviet, and later to the Nazi occupation authorities. The organization operated mainly in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia, as well as in exile. Aiming to establish an independent, united Ukrainian state, the organization relied on right-wing radical ideology and practice, which made it similar to similar political movements in Europe at the time. It should be noted that the liberation movement in Ukraine was not homogeneous either. There were various underground groups and organizations that, for various reasons, could not unite their efforts to achieve a single goal and were often at odds with each other.\n\nThe end of the war did not bring peace to Luxembourg either. After the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne, the country was gripped by revolutionary fever. The workers\' and peasants\' council, supported by the crowd, demanded the overthrow of the monarchy and the proclamation of a republic. The newly formed French League also wanted to establish a republic in Luxembourg under the protection of French sovereignty. Belgium put forward its own territorial claims. The fate of the dynasty hung in the balance. At this difficult time, the Grand Duchess proposed a referendum in which the people would choose the form of government. It should be noted that Maria-Adelaide was characterized by a special "mystical state of mind" from childhood, and in her youth she decided that she would never marry and that "Lottie should rule" [Paul Lafontaine. Unsere Dynastie: Die Ursprünge der Nassauer und die Herrschaft der Nassau-Weilburger im Großherzogtum Luxemburg (1890-1990) (1990)]. Therefore, she did not hold on to power and decided to abdicate in favor of her sister. The short, but eventful and tragically completed biography of Grand Duchess Maria Adelaide is thoroughly reflected in the work of Dr. Josiane Weber. Her research, based on historical sources, balances the imbalance of the Grand Duchess\'s political role and her importance in the history of Luxembourg [Josiane Weber. Großherzogin Marie Adelheid von Luxemburg. Eine politische Biografie (1912-1919) (2019)]. A summary of the research results is presented in the researcher\'s lecture (in German).
