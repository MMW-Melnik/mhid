					"Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People of creative professions perceive the world in a special way, and determine their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His “Yesterday's World,” which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is rather a biography of an entire generation that had to survive two world wars; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written while in exile on another continent. [^source1]"

				QUOTE: [
					'"...When I try to find a proper definition for the pre-World War I era in which I grew up, I think it would be more accurate to say that it was a golden age of reliability. Everything in our almost thousand-year old Austrian monarchy seemed to be designed to last forever, and the state was the ultimate guarantor of this permanence. The rights it provided to its citizens were enshrined in the parliament, this freely elected representative of the people, and every duty was strictly regulated. This touching conviction that one could build a palisade around oneself without leaving any loopholes for any intrusion of fate, was, for all its practicality and moderation, a fair amount of dangerous vanity.\n\nThe nineteenth century, in its liberal idealism, was sincerely convinced that it was on the straight and narrow path to the “best of all worlds.” It looked down on previous eras with their wars, famines, and turmoil as a time when humanity was still underaged and insufficiently educated. They believed in such relapses of barbarism as the wars between the peoples of Europe as little as they believed in witches and ghosts; our parents were convinced of the strength of the binding force of tolerance and friendliness. They sincerely believed that the boundaries and differences between nations and religions would gradually be erased in universal humanity, and that peace and security, the highest goods, were destined for all mankind...\n\n"'

				'CHARLOTTE LUXEMBOURG': {
					INTRODUCTION: [
						'It always seems to ordinary people that the life of monarchs resembles an interesting and vividly illustrated fairy tale. The biography of Princess Charlotte of Luxembourg dispels this myth. Her life story is like a drama, but with a happy ending. On the one hand, it was the life of an ordinary person, in which sadness and joy, happiness and suffering alternated. It was the life of a woman who had a loving family and home from birth, received an education, became a wife and mother of six children. At the same time, her life was regulated by her special status, which imposed certain responsibilities and limited her personal freedom. Given this, Charlotte had to show great ingenuity to cope with all the challenges and difficulties and to organize her life as she saw fit. It is extremely interesting to trace all the twists and turns of this complex but interesting personal story.\n\nThe Nassau dynasty was one of the oldest European noble families with great wealth and possessions. Princess Charlotte was born into this family on January 23, 1896. She was the second of six daughters in the family of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Luxembourg and his wife, Princess Maria Anna of Portugal of the Braganza dynasty.'
					],
					SISTERS: [
						"The girl had an older sister, Maria Adelaide, and younger sisters, Hilda, Antoinette, Elizabeth, and Sofia. The country was ruled by her grandfather Adolf I. After his death in 1905, the princesses' father inherited the Luxembourg throne. Duke Wilhelm was worried that in the absence of an heir, his family might lose not only power but also their home."
					],
					INHERITANCE: [
						"Therefore, he did everything possible to keep his family in power. He managed to agree with the government on changes to the Nassau-Weilburg family charter. This meant that the Luxembourg princesses would have a preemptive right to the throne in the Grand Duchy in order of birth. It is worth noting that the Duke's worries were not in vain. Unexpectedly, a contender of Russian descent, Count Georg von Merenberg, a descendant of the Grand Duke's brother Adolf by a morganatic marriage with the daughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, declared his right to the throne.\n\nHowever, after a heated debate, the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies approved a law changing the succession to the throne in favor of princesses.[^source2]It should be noted that this was an extremely progressive decision. According to the rules of the time, women could not count on the regency or the throne. Monarchical power was inherited exclusively through the male line. Meanwhile, Count von Merenberg managed to pay off his claims with a substantial annual pension.\n\n"
					],
					DIFFICULTIES: [
						"Duke William was seriously ill from the moment he inherited the throne until the end of his life. His wife, Duchess Maria-Anne, took care of her seriously ill husband herself, so Charlotte and her sisters' childhood were not very happy. For example, the family was forced to move frequently because most of the existing residences were unsuitable for a comfortable life and their father's health. Under such conditions, the children were only able to receive a home education. Her initial course was supplemented with gymnastics, fencing, and English, German, and French lessons. In addition, the princesses learned to ride and swim. All other sciences were introduced to the children of the Grand Ducal family by a professor of philology, who for a long time shared with them the inconvenience of frequent travel.\n\n",
						"The lives of the princesses were strictly regulated and controlled, accompanied by various restrictions. The parliament, the government, church officials, and the press were closely monitoring all events in the life of the Archduke's family, taking into account his health. Thus, sisters Charlotte and Hilda were not allowed to celebrate their First Communion in a lavish manner, as was customary even in ordinary families. St. Michael's parish replied that “due to ‘certain circumstances’ this was not possible.” Therefore, the communion was held “quietly and modestly in the chapel of the Hohenburg Palace”...[^source3]\n\n",
						"Deprived of the opportunity to attend school, communicate freely with their peers, and grow up like ordinary children, the princesses were brought up in isolation, limited to their family circle, teachers, and governesses. Certainly, the experience of growing up with a seriously ill father and a mother exhausted by caring for him and his suffering was quite traumatic for the children of the Grand Ducal family. Also, the government and the general public were dissatisfied with the monarch's long absence from the country. Researchers noted the “alienation” of the ruling family, which eventually had critical consequences for the dynasty.\n\n"
					],
					SPECULATIONS: [
						"The governments of different countries used their ambassadors to monitor the behavior of the princesses. Where they traveled, where they stayed, who was part of their entourage, and so on. The newspapers described in detail the princesses' lives and various rumors related to their possible marriage. Moreover, statesmen discussed possible partners for the princesses' future marriages, which would be beneficial primarily to the state. Obviously, the excessive public attention that accompanied the princesses' lives contributed to the formation of their special character traits and the adoption of special behavioral patterns.\n\n"
					],
					ACTIVITY: {
						CONTENT: [
							"Princesses Mary Adelaide and Charlotte began their representative duties early on, given their difficult family circumstances. Because of Mary Adelaide's particular vulnerability, at her mother's request, Charlotte accompanied her sister everywhere, preparing to take over the monarch's duties if necessary. The sisters attracted attention by their opposites. Mary Adelaide was characterized by restraint, shyness, and piety. Charlotte, on the other hand, was cheerful and open. The proof can be found in the words of the German ambassador to Luxembourg, Count Schwerin, who described Charlotte in his report:\n\n",
							"Hunting was a popular pastime of the time. Unlike her older sister, Charlotte “showed a great passion” for this activity.[^source4] Obviously, Princess Mary Adelaide was not ready for the role of Grand Duchess. First of all, because she was too young and inexperienced when she lost her father and inherited the throne. The whole country, together with the Grand Duchess's family, had a hard time with his death in 1912.[^source5]\n\n",
							'The lavish funeral of her father, the oppressive atmosphere of mourning, and the burden of responsibility for the fate of the dynasty could not but affect the vulnerability of the main heiress. Her contemporaries testified to her aloofness, concentration, and manifestations of a strong, authoritarian character at that time. At the same time, Charlotte, being close to her sister, gained valuable experience that helped her in the future.'
						],
						QUOTE: [
							'“The princess is as gifted as her older sister, but fortunately does not suffer from such embarrassment. She makes every effort to fulfill her official duties. But she feels much more comfortable in a private circle, where her lively, cheerful temperament comes through. Everyone praises her for her special, cordial kindness... this friendliness is the main feature of her character, and her very elegant appearance is in perfect harmony with it...”'

				'SOFIA FEDAK': {
					CHILDHOOD: [
						'In contrast, the childhood of another heroine of our project, Sofia Fedak, was calm and carefree. She was born in Lviv (at that time it was the territory of Austria-Hungary) on October 30, 1901, into an extraordinary family and was provided with everything she needed from childhood. Her father, Stepan Fedak, was a prominent Lviv jurist, lawyer, and one of the richest Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia. Some contemporary Ukrainian researchers call him “one of the then oligarchs of Austria-Hungary”.[^source5] His eldest daughter jokingly called herself “the daughter of a wealthy Lviv patrician”.[^source6]'
					],
					MOVEMENT: {
						CONTENT: [
							'It is worth noting that in the second half of the nineteenth century, Galicia became the center of the Ukrainian national movement, the so-called “Ukrainian Piedmont.” Oppressed and disenfranchised for a long time, Ukrainian peasants gradually realized the shamefulness of their situation, especially in comparison to other enslaved peoples of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Social protests were combined with political slogans that eventually became radicalized. Along with the demands for autonomy and universal suffrage, the idea of gaining independence was voiced. In the social aspect, the leadership of the Ukrainian national movement at the turn of the century gradually passed to secular intellectuals.',

							"However, Stepan Fedak tried to avoid politics and concentrated on his professional activities. He opened his own law office in Lviv, which provided legal assistance to both individuals and Ukrainian institutions. For some time, he headed the Union of Ukrainian Advocates, contributed to the establishment and operation of various Ukrainian financial and economic institutions, which were also centers of public life. The lawyers of Stepan Fedak's generation were vividly characterized by their contemporary, Ukrainian politician Lev Hankevych:\n\n",

							"Although categorically unwilling to engage in politics, Sofia's father, Stepan Fedak, nevertheless proved himself to be an active figure in the social and political life of Galicia. According to researchers of his activities, “among the Ukrainian elite of the region at the time, the figure tried in every possible way to abstract himself from political activity, but he did not always succeed.” [^source5]\n\n",

							"Being a strong and even authoritarian man in any matters related to his professional interests, Stepan Fedak left the house and upbringing of his children entirely to his wife Maria Fedak-Sichynska, who came from a Greek Catholic priest's family, where morality and religiosity traditionally reigned supreme. Maria's father, Father Lukian Sichynsky, was a cousin of one of the most famous Ukrainian politicians, Oleksandr Barvinsky, and the girl's mother, Natalia Brylynska, was the sister of the famous lawyer Yevhen Olesnytsky, who introduced the young couple.\n\n"

						QUOTE: [
							'“...This is a new generation of Ukrainian palestra. These are no longer “defenders of the gentry, bourgeoisie, and industrialists,” but defenders of the entire nation. All of them are already nationally conscious, people of European culture...'

					},
					MARRIAGE: {
						CONTENT: [
							"An interesting fact is that in the Uniate Church of Galicia, the marriage oath was as follows: a woman swore to her husband to love, fidelity, and obedience, and he swore to her to love and fidelity. Despite the patriarchal upbringing that determined the future education of a Galician girl within the family, household, church, and child-rearing, Sofia's mother was active in the women's educational movement in Galicia."
						],
						QUOTE: [
							'“Mrs. Maria, a small woman, always calm, unspoken, kept the house on Sykstuska Street in Lviv in exemplary order with a strong hand and took care of the decent upbringing of all eight children. And the children were brought up as conscious Ukrainians, participating in the political life of their land...”'
						]
					},
					EQUALITY: [
						"Maria was one of the first to focus on the role of women in society. According to archival data, Mariia Fedak had the right to participate (together with her husband) in the election of deputies to the Lviv City Council for the period from 1913-1914.[^source8] This detail shows the equality of S. Fedak's wife not only in the home but also in public affairs. It is not surprising that the children were brought up as conscious Ukrainians, taking an active part in the political life of their land. There were 8 children in the family: daughters Halyna (Olena), Olha, Mariia, Sofia, Oksana, Daria, and sons Stefan-Jaroslav and Bohdan.\n\n",

						"Sofia's parents maintained friendly relations with such famous families in Lviv at the time as the Shukhevychs, Nahirni, and Levytski. They also visited Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky and Ivan Franko, with whom Stepan Fedak was connected through publishing and friendly relations. At the turn of 1921-1922, the well-known organizer and leader of the Ukrainian women's movement, teacher and literary critic Sofia Rusova lived in the Fedak household for some time. The young Roman Shukhevych (the future leader of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army), who was a brilliant storyteller and virtuoso pianist, repeatedly visited the Fedak house for youth meetings, attracting the attention of all the girls present, including those from the host's family.\n\n",

						"Sofia's niece, Olha Kuzmovych, described the traditions of the Fedak family in an extremely vivid way in her memoirs of her childhood years spent in her grandparents' home. She recalled that in the courtyard of the Fedak family home there was a separate room for “mademoiselle.” A governess lived there and taught the family's children German and French. There was also a watchman who guarded the house and locked the heavy metal “brama” (gate) at night, making the house seem like a reliable fortress. [^source9] Her memoirs reveal a whole world of a wealthy Lviv family with detailed descriptions of everyday life, traditions, and customs. Particularly touching are the memories of Christmas, which was celebrated in the Fedak family with great fanfare, observing the traditional rite.\n\n"
					],

					TENSION: [
						"The example of the Fedak family illustrates the impact of global political events on the everyday life of Galician Ukrainians. In particular, Sofia's older sister Olena recalled how her parents discussed the resonant event that took place on April 12, 1908—the assassination of the governor of Galicia, Andrzej Potocki, by a student of Lviv University, Myroslav Sichynskyi. Sichynsky was a relative of Maria Fedak, and she “as the greatest ‘revolutionary’ of us all was outraged by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky's condemnation of this act”.[^source10]",

						"This example demonstrates the high level of tension in Ukrainian society at the time. When an educated woman from a traditional patriarchal family, a civic activist who was widely involved in charity work, actually approved of the terrorist attack. And she expected a similar reaction from the metropolitan of the Greek Catholic Church.\n\nAt the same time, her husband considered Sheptytsky's statement a “political tactic.” Stepan Fedak “by his nature was inclined to live in harmony with everyone and reconcile everyone rather than to fight with opponents of other views” [^source10]. It is also known that after 3 years of imprisonment, Myroslav escaped from prison and emigrated to the United States via Western Europe. Researchers claim that his rescue was organized and financed by the family of Stepan Fedak.[^source12]",

						"In addition, Olena Fedak described in detail the leisure activities of her parents' family. The children attended all the children's parties in the city, concerts and performances in Ukrainian and Polish theaters. In winter, they skated on a frozen pond, and in summer they went swimming and played tennis. Vacations were spent either in the Ukrainian Carpathians (Kosiv, Yaremche, Vorokhta) or abroad (Belgium, Switzerland). For the then 20-year-old Olena, the prewar year remained in her memories as “one big leisure time: dances, balls, home ‘fife’ (tea parties), theater, concerts, parties...” [^source10]"

			INTRODUCTION: [
				"For Ukraine, the First World War was a tragedy. The main reason was the lack of statehood, which forced Ukrainians to fight against each other in the armies of the warring parties. Millions of Ukrainians died for someone else's interests, and these interests were hypothetical even for the leaders of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires who owned Ukrainian lands at the time. At the same time, it is important to know that in the course of this war, Ukraine briefly gained independence. Ukrainians gained important historical experience that required revenge. The national liberation struggle in Ukraine during the Great War gave rise to a cohort of future fighters for the independence of the Ukrainian people.\n\n",

				"Luxembourg also experienced serious upheaval. Contrary to international law, which was supposed to ensure Luxembourg's 'eternal' neutrality, the country was occupied by German troops. The German government ignored diplomatic protests. Officially, the occupation of Luxembourg was not considered hostile: the state and local administration remained intact, and political life continued. However, the German military authorities constantly interfered in the governance of the state. Thousands of Luxembourgers volunteered for the French Foreign Legion. The paradox was that the German Emperor Wilhelm II was an uncle to the Luxembourg princesses. The Grand Duchess Maria-Adelaide made great efforts to preserve the country's independence.\n\n After the occupation of Luxembourg, she met with Wilhelm II in Luxembourg during his visit to the Western Front. On the advice of the Minister of State, an unofficial secret meeting was arranged, but the information was leaked to French newspapers. The Grand Duchess's actions seriously damaged Luxembourg's reputation in France. In addition, her reign fell on difficult times, she suffered too many trials and eventually abdicated in favor of her younger sister."
			],
			CHARLOTTE: [
				"With the outbreak of the Great War, the Grand Duchess Mary Adelaide took care of the humanitarian side of the war, proposing to establish a private Red Cross company with her support. Princess Charlotte and her other sisters were always there to help and support the Duchess. The princesses also participated in the work of public kitchens during the crisis, charity concerts, etc. [^source13]\n\nIn general, the situation during the war was traditionally difficult. Given the occupation and the economic crisis caused by the war, any government would have been challenged to cope with such difficulties. However, if the government can resign, the monarch has no such choice. The patriotism of the Luxembourgers grew all the more as they were guided by the behavior of their duchess.\n\nAt this time, Princess Charlotte was gaining valuable experience in governing the state, sharing all the difficulties with her older sister. Their mother, Duchess Marie-Anne, who had raised them together since childhood, encouraged them to behave this way. But at the same time, there were interesting changes in Princess Charlotte's personal life.\n\nOn the eve of the war, at the wedding of her cousin Zita Bourbon-Parma, the future Empress of Austria, Princess Charlotte met her brother Felix, whom she later married. Charlotte was lucky enough to choose her own marriage partner, which was rare among royal families at the time.\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte and Felix were brought together not only by family ties, which were a serious obstacle to marriage. They were also united by the traumatic experience of the early loss of their father and the need to take responsibility for their own future at a young age.\n\nIt is appropriate here to elaborate on the biography of the future Prince Consort of Luxembourg.\n\nThe Bourbon-Parma monarchs lived in Schwarzau Castle in Austria after the Duke of Parma lost his throne in 1859, but they retained palaces and estates in Austria, France, and Italy. Although their father considered the family primarily French, Felix and his siblings grew up speaking Italian, French, Portuguese, English, German, and Spanish, reflecting their mixed ancestry and cosmopolitan upbringing.\n\nDespite the family's wealth, Felix's personal possessions were quite modest. As the youngest son, he had a small inheritance, which forced him to make his own way in life. As a child, Felix received a primary home education, and from the age of 10 he studied at the Jesuit school Stella Matutina in Feldkirch (Austria). This institution was characterized by strict discipline. He continued his education in Brixen (Tyrol) and at a Jesuit school in Vienna. He received his high school diploma at a school in Medling, Lower Austria. He then studied in England at Stonyhurst College to prepare for admission to Oxford. But the war changed all his plans.\n\nFelix graduated from the Vienna Military Academy before joining the Austrian army with his brother René. He served as an officer in the Austrian 15th Dragoon Regiment, participating mainly in battles in Italy. The war divided his family. Two of his brothers served in the Belgian army, at a time when Belgium and Austria were at war. Sources indicate that Felix distinguished himself with particular bravery at the front, including saving the life of his brother-in-law, the Austrian Emperor Charles. He left the army because of his engagement with Princess Charlotte shortly before the end of the war.\n\nHis level of education and life experience suggest that Felix was better prepared for the role of monarch than Charlotte. He also learned the difficulties of monarchs’ life without a throne from the example of his own family. Therefore, over time, being already in the status of Prince Consort of Luxembourg, he made every effort to preserve the monarchy in the Grand Duchy. And, of course, he was a powerful support for his wife in state affairs. Thanks to his title, his large family, and his military career, Felix had valuable connections in wide political circles, which he successfully used in difficult situations."

In total, more than 60 percent of the study hours were devoted to learning languages."'

				GALICIA_BATTLEFIELD: [
					"Throughout the war, Ukrainian Galicia was the main battlefield on the Eastern Front. The population suffered from destruction, damage, and abuse by both imperial armies. Persecution of nationally conscious Ukrainians began. The occupation was accompanied by mass deportations and executions. This wave of violence naturally provoked strong resistance. Not a single Ukrainian family remained unaffected by the political and social changes that were taking place at the time. It is only natural that Sofia's family also became closely involved in the national liberation movement of Ukrainian Galicia. Moreover, this involvement influenced her entire life."
				],
				SISTERS_EDUCATION: [
					"When the war started, Sofia was just a child. She was brought up at home, where she received her primary education. Then she followed the path of her sisters: a traditional family upbringing and a thorough education, started at a prestigious women's gymnasium and completed at the Przemyśl Institute or at universities in Austria-Hungary. For example, her older sister Olena, who had been involved in her parents' active social life since childhood and was accustomed to publicity, first studied at a private Polish women's gymnasium in Lviv. Later she recalled that the monthly tuition fee was equal to the monthly salary of an average government official, and most subjects were taught by university professors. [^source14]",

					"In addition to Polish and German, students of the gymnasium also studied Latin and classical Greek. Most of the gymnasium's graduates later became well-known public figures in Galicia. Before the war, Olena graduated from Lviv University, then studied journalism in Berlin and philosophy in Vienna. During the war, she was involved in the Ukrainian Women's Committee for Aid to Wounded Soldiers, which provided charitable support to Ukrainians in Austrian hospitals. During this difficult time, Olena married Lev Sheparovych, a cadet in the Austrian army. It came as a surprise to many in her circle that 'the richest and most desirable bride in Lviv chose a young man without wealth or rank.' [^source15]",
					'Given the circumstances of wartime, the wedding was "modest and elegant, with the quiet blessing of her parents." [^source16]'

				SPECIAL_OLGA: [
					"Sofia had a special relationship with her other sister, Olga (the second daughter of the Fedak family). It is known that Olga studied violin in Lviv, and in 1915 she graduated with honors from the Vienna Conservatory. Olga was called by her contemporaries 'the most charming and gentle' of S. Fedak's six daughters. The combination of the Spanish type of beauty with refined fragility gave her the character of a loner and a coddler. Her family called her 'Mruchok' for her special isolation and restraint, as well as her frequent absence of smiles.",

					"The main reason for the family members' special treatment of Olga was her lingering lung disease and her vulnerable character. She was predicted to become an outstanding violinist, but her musical career ended after her first solo concert in Vienna, which was a great success. However, after that, Olga was no longer able to perform in public because of a painful 'tremor' that could not be cured. The real reason for this painful condition remained a secret for a long time. It was only later, when she was alone, that Olga told her niece that at that concert, while performing Paganini's variations, a string broke on her violin. The panic and fear that literally paralyzed her at that moment endured for the rest of her life. [^source17]"
				],
				PRIMARY_SOLO: [
					"As for Sofia's primary education, it is only known that she graduated from the Lysenko Music Academy in Lviv. At the beginning of the war, on the eve of the occupation of Galicia by Russian troops, the entire Fedak family, except for the father, moved to Vienna. Unfortunately, there is no information about this period of their lives. Stepan Fedak remained in Lviv as vice president (deputy mayor) of the city. According to Lviv newspapers of the time, he publicly expressed 'a statement of loyalty and allegiance of the Ukrainian people to the Austrian dynasty and monarchy.' [^source18]",

					"It is also known that in August 1914, Dr. Fedak attended a secret meeting chaired by Metropolitan A. Sheptytsky with the participation of Ukrainian politicians and representatives of Austrian government circles. The meeting discussed 'the creation and provision of a separate Ukrainian military legion called the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen.' [^source19]"

				STEPAN_FEDAK: [
					"In occupied Lviv, S. Fedak used all his connections and professional qualities to be as useful as possible to Ukrainians in such a difficult period. However, he could not escape repression. In 1915, he became a hostage of the Russian Bolshevik authorities and was taken to Kyiv along with other civic activists in Lviv. Interestingly, his granddaughter's memories of the family's Christmas celebrations contain different information:",

					"While in Kyiv as an internee, Stepan Fedak founded the Society for the Care and Assistance of Ukrainians from Galicia, which supported deported Galicians in various parts of the enemy empire. In the summer of 1916, S. Fedak was able to return home. The circumstances of his release are currently unknown. Researchers claim that Dr. Fedak and two other Galician hostages 'were exchanged for a captured Russian consul and after a long trip through Finland, Sweden, and Germany he returned to Lviv.' [^source21] This interesting fact once again confirms the outstanding personality of Sofia Fedak's father."

				LEGION_ANDRIY: [
					"As for the Legion of Sich Riflemen, such a unit was indeed created. Its existence allowed Ukrainians to train personnel and acquire weapons and military experience to use in the war for independence. It was in this legion that Sofia's future husband, Andriy Melnyk, served during the war. His complex biography deserves a separate study. However, some facts are worth mentioning here.",

					"Melnyk was born on December 12, 1890, in a small village in the Lviv region. He lost his parents early on, who died of tuberculosis, and was raised by his stepmother. The people who replaced Andriy's parents were distinguished by special human qualities, which is confirmed by some facts from his biography. In particular, the adoptive parents took care of their adopted son's health, paying for his long and complicated treatment for tuberculosis, as well as his education.",

					'Researchers of his biography claim that Andriy Melnyk first studied at elementary schools in Sambir and Drohobych. He continued his education at the Franz Josef I Gymnasium in Drohobych, where he lived in the gymnasium dormitory from the age of 10. Later, he graduated from the prestigious gymnasium in Stryi, where Ukrainian classes functioned from 1906-1918. The curriculum of the gymnasium was very intense:',

					"In 1910, Andriy Melnyk was among five graduates who finished high school with honors and received a diploma with the right to enter higher education. When the First World War broke out, Andriy studied at the Vienna University of Natural Resources, Faculty of Forestry. Sources indicate that '...tuition was paid and quite expensive, so Melnyk's family sold part of their land to provide their stepson with the opportunity to study.' [^source23]",

					'Many well-known members of the Ukrainian national liberation movement and ministers of the Greek Catholic Church studied at this gymnasium at different times. In particular, Stepan Bandera and his two brothers. In the summer of 1914, Andriy Melnyk left his studies, returned to Lviv, and began his military career in the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (USS) as part of the Austro-Hungarian army. During the battles in the Carpathians, he was taken prisoner by Russia and spent almost a year in prisoner-of-war camps. It was there that Melnyk met Yevhen Konovalets, whose friendship had a dramatic impact on his future life.'

Later, Olena Fedak (Sheparovych) recalled: I could not be just a passive spectator on those great days; I wanted to be active with all the cells of my mind and heart...',

					"After the defeat of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic, Olena accompanied her husband, who was retreating to the Naddniprianshchyna (Dnieper Ukraine) as part of the Ukrainian Galician Army.

			'In the interwar period, the territory of Ukraine was divided between 4 neighboring states. \nThe situation of Ukrainians was complicated by the fact that the central and eastern Ukrainian lands were part of Soviet Russia and experienced all the consequences of the totalitarian Bolshevik regime. \nThe western Ukrainian territories, divided between Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, had a different experience. \n\nSuch an ill-considered solution by world politicians to the "Ukrainian question," which was relevant to international relations at the time, had severe consequences for the Ukrainian people. \nFor most European countries, this short period of return to peaceful life was imprinted in the collective memory of Ukrainians by repression and genocide by the Soviet regime and by the Polish government\'s harsh chauvinistic assimilation policy, which was accompanied by deportations of the population and attacks on the Ukrainian language and church. \nA similar anti-Ukrainian policy, albeit in a somewhat milder form, was pursued by the governments of Romania and Czechoslovakia, respectively, in relation to Bukovina and Transcarpathia (Zakarpattia). \n\nIt is quite understandable that such a rigid and sometimes brutal policy made Ukrainians perceive the new government as an occupying power and provoked active resistance. \nIn particular, the residents of the western part of Ukraine opposed it strongly, using both legal and underground methods of struggle, including terror. \n\nThroughout the stateless period, the interests of Ukrainians in the world were represented by the Ukrainian diaspora. \nThe main flow of political emigration occurred in the early 1920s. \nResearchers claim that "in 1921 the number of Ukrainian immigrants in Western European countries reached almost 100 thousand people." [^source26] \n\nA significant part of the emigrants were members of the national liberation movement who did not want to accept defeat and continued to fight for Ukraine\'s independence. \nAmong the political emigrants in Vienna, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was created in 1929 and was headed by Yevhen Konovalets. \n\nFounded as an underground patriotic movement, the OUN quickly became a powerful force. \nIn 1933, it was legalized in Ukraine as a public organization. \nThe OUN led the Ukrainian resistance movement, first to the Polish, then to the Soviet, and later to the Nazi occupation authorities. \nThe organization operated mainly in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia, as well as in exile. \n\nAiming to establish an independent, united Ukrainian state, the organization relied on right-wing radical ideology and practice, which made it similar to similar political movements in Europe at the time. \n\nIt should be noted that the liberation movement in Ukraine was not homogeneous either. \nThere were various underground groups and organizations that, for various reasons, could not unite their efforts to achieve a single goal and were often at odds with each other. \n\nThe end of the war did not bring peace to Luxembourg either. \nAfter the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne, the country was gripped by revolutionary fever. \nThe workers\' and peasants\' council, supported by the crowd, demanded the overthrow of the monarchy and the proclamation of a republic. \n\nThe newly formed French League also wanted to establish a republic in Luxembourg under the protection of French sovereignty. \nBelgium put forward its own territorial claims. \nThe fate of the dynasty hung in the balance. \n\nAt this difficult time, the Grand Duchess proposed a referendum in which the people would choose the form of government. \nIt should be noted that Maria-Adelaide was characterized by a special "mystical state of mind" from childhood, and in her youth she decided that she would never marry and that "Lottie should rule" [^source27]. \n\nTherefore, she did not hold on to power and decided to abdicate in favor of her sister. \n\nThe short but eventful and tragically completed biography of Grand Duchess Maria Adelaide is thoroughly reflected in the work of Dr. Josiane Weber. \nHer research, based on historical sources, balances the imbalance of the Grand Duchess\'s political role and her importance in the history of Luxembourg [^source28]. \n\nA summary of the research results is presented in the researcher\'s lecture (in German). \n[^source29].'

			'Princess Charlotte became the head of state on January 15, 1919. However, gaining power was not easy. She had to fight for the throne. \n\nThe diplomatic situation threatened Charlotte with the loss of power and the state with the loss of independence. Difficult negotiations with the French government resulted in an agreement to grant Charlotte the duchy on the condition that she marries Felix, who held the title of French Bourbon. Thus, it can be stated that the title of Prince Felix saved the Duchy from losing its independence. \n\nThe referendum ensured internal stability. On September 28, 1919, almost 80% of the population of Luxembourg voted in favor of preserving the monarchy headed by the Grand Duchess Charlotte. \n\nAt the same time, a constitution was adopted that declared the nation sovereign and clearly regulated the powers of the monarch. It is worth noting that the monarchy was saved by women, who were granted the right to vote for the first time on the eve of the referendum. Until that time, the female population of the Duchy had no influence on political life, but they had always unofficially supported the "princesses of Berg Castle," sympathizing with them and criticizing government officials. [^source30] \n\nThe former princess\'s personal life was also full of surprises. In particular, the vicissitudes of the marriage of the Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma deserve special attention. \n\nIt is clear that their engagement and wedding were the subject of increased public attention. This is confirmed by numerous archival publications and photographs. However, the peculiarity of the status of monarchs is that public interest in their private lives is not limited to chronological timeframes. \n\nFrom the memoirs of the American Papal Privy Counselor (Chamberlain) [^source31] Francis Augustus MacNutt, it became known that this marriage was concluded by proxy and out of the public eye on March 24, 1919, in Switzerland at the Wartegg Castle. \n\nIf we take into account the civil wedding ceremony that took place on the morning of November 6th of the same year in the Grand Ducal Palace of Luxembourg, it turns out that Charlotte married three times to the same man. The details of Charlotte and Felix\'s first (secret) wedding ceremony became known over time from eyewitness accounts, as did the reasons for it. \n\nPrince Felix could not come to Luxembourg, but he had documents that allowed him to marry. One of the witnesses was the Austrian Emperor Charles (Felix\'s brother-in-law). The bride was represented by her sister Maria Adelheid. Perhaps such secrets were due to the peculiarities of marriage between relatives. \n\nThis required special permission from the Pope, which Prince Felix managed to obtain. Difficulties also arose in Charlotte\'s homeland. The Luxembourgers were wary of the future prince, who had fought in an enemy coalition. The public was also concerned about the presence of feelings between the newlyweds. By the way, this question still interests researchers of the Grand Ducal family. [^source32] \n\nHowever, the young couple overcame all obstacles. Obviously, they were helped by influential relatives, friends, and officials interested in establishing stability. It was during this relatively calm interwar period that the couple had six children: Jean, Elizabeth, Marie-Adelaide, Marie-Gabrielle, Charles, and Alix. \n\nThe whole country celebrated the birth of their first child, the heir to the throne. In response to the congratulations, Charlotte said a phrase that became a catchphrase: "Ich dien" ("I serve"). [^source33] \n\nIt is worth noting that by giving birth to a son and choosing a common name for him, the Grand Duchess won the "battle" with the opponents of the monarchy, significantly strengthening the throne. Prince Jean became the first male heir to the throne born on Luxembourg\'s soil. In traditional societies, such things have always been of great importance and had important political consequences. \n\nThe dynastic issue became irrelevant, and the enemies of the Grand Ducal House were pacified. However, the happy life was overshadowed by a new war.'

			'The Riga Peace Treaty of 1921 recognized Poland\'s right to Eastern Galicia. This ill-considered decision of the Entente countries, aggravated by various types of discrimination by the restored Polish state, caused active resistance among Western Ukrainians. \n\nThe Polish authorities were perceived as occupiers, so they tried to get rid of them by any means necessary, using both legal and underground methods of struggle that included terror. This situation arose quite naturally. \n\nThe participants of the national liberation struggle who survived the hell of war, refusing to accept the defeat of their idea, tried to take revenge on those who were lucky enough to be in the victorious camp. Later, after realizing that there were no prospects for continuing the struggle, most of its participants left their homeland. \n\nA typical example of a Ukrainian of this era was Stepan Fedak, Sofia\'s brother, who joined the Ukrainian Insurgent Army at the age of 14 and fought in the Ukrainian Galician Army. Fedak was a member of the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), created by Yevhen Konovalets, and became famous for his assassination attempt of the head of the Polish state, Józef Piłsudski, in September 1921. \n\nA Polish court sentenced the young man to six years in prison, but he was released in 1924 and left the country. It is known that after this arrest, Stepan\'s mother, the calm "Mamunka" (as Maria Fedak was affectionately called by her family), quietly but firmly stated after a nighttime search of the house: "I am proud that it was my son who fulfilled this attentat." [^source34] \n\nThis position of a woman who approved of her son\'s terrorist attack reflects the mood of the majority of society. At the same time, Stepan\'s actions had unpleasant consequences for other family members. In particular, his father, Stepan Fedak (senior), made every effort to reach an understanding with the new government and reconcile the opponents. \n\nAccording to his contemporaries, he belonged to the conservative wing of Ukrainian politicians who hoped to achieve the desired result through negotiations, and was "more inclined to live in harmony with everyone and reconcile everyone than to fight with opponents of other views." [^source35] \n\nAt the same time, Dr. Fedak\'s words that "Poles and Ukrainians are people, and people can find common ground" [^source36] did not find support among young people of that time. This fact proves the differences in political views between representatives of different generations, which has been observed more than once in the public life of Ukrainians. \n\nAfter the attack, Dr. Fedak was arrested and spent 2 months in prison. His eldest daughter Olena recalled that "the whole Fedak family felt the consequences of the atentat." [^source37] \n\nIn particular, her husband, Lev Sheparovych, lost his job, they were forced to leave Lviv and moved to Germany for several years. During this difficult period for the family, Sofia studied at the Trade Academy in Vienna. After graduating in 1923, she worked at the Audit Union of Ukrainian Cooperatives in Lviv. From 1924, she was the bride of Andriy Melnyk. In the same year, he was sentenced by the Polish authorities to four years in prison for underground pro-Ukrainian activities. \n\nSofia went to the prison with packages to her fiancé every day for four years. It is not known for certain where the young couple met. Perhaps it happened on a train to Vienna, where they both received higher education and often traveled from home to study. This simple way of meeting was quite common among Ukrainian students. \n\nIt is also likely that Andriy Melnyk was introduced to the Fedak family, as well as Metropolitan Sheptytsky, by a well-known Ukrainian politician and public figure, Yevhen Olesnytskyi, who was Sofia\'s mother\'s uncle. Olesnytsky began to take care of Andriy from the time he studied at the Stryi Gymnasium. It is also known that it was thanks to Andriy Melnyk that Yevhen Konovalets met and later married Olena Fedak. \n\nAs the leader of an underground pro-Ukrainian organization (UVO), it was dangerous for Konovalets to remain in Ukraine. In December 1922, his wife and he emigrated to the West. They lived in exile in various European countries until the end of their lives, and Yevhen Konovalets never stopped searching for new methods of fighting for Ukraine\'s independence. \n\nAfter the end of their imprisonment, Andriy and Sofia were able to marry. The wedding took place on February 28, 1929, in the chapel of the Theological Seminary in Lviv. The couple had no children. Andriy Melnyk did not like to show off his personal family life and forbade his supporters to write about it. \n\nPerhaps this was the result of the torture he suffered in Russian captivity and the Polish prison. Melnyk later recalled his time in the Polish prison: "they beat me so much that it reached the League of Nations" [^source38] \n\nLawyer S. Fedak was involved in this publicity. In September 1925, he participated in the trial of a case of beating prisoners in a Lviv prison, where his son-in-law, a member of the UVO, A. Melnyk, was also held at the time. The lawyer ensured that the matter was considered by the Polish Sejm and that a note of protest was sent to the League of Nations, as well as that the horrific incident was widely covered in the domestic and foreign press. \n\nSofia and Andriy wanted to develop their family in their native Galicia. Sofia continued her work at the Audit Union and, together with her mother and sisters, initiated the creation of the Ukrainian Society of Women with Higher Education, which promoted the ideas of Ukrainian feminism. \n\nDespite the intense military and revolutionary life, Colonel Melnyk managed to complete his education in Vienna and receive his diploma. After the war, he began working as a forestry engineer in the estates of the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. These forests were famous far beyond the borders of Galicia. \n\nIt is known that at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries European aristocrats came to the Carpathians to hunt deer. In particular, Ukrainian archives contain references and photographs of Archduke Rudolf of Habsburg-Lorraine, Archduke Miguel of Braganza, and Archduchess Maria Theresa, daughter of the King of Portugal, hunting in Zakarpattia (Transcarpathia). This tradition continued after the war. \n\nMelnyk, who had a university degree and spoke foreign languages, met "high" guests with whom he could easily communicate. The memoirs of one of Melnyk\'s future political associates reveal an interesting detail, possibly heard from the colonel himself, about his acquaintance with Prince Felix, the Consort of Luxembourg. \n\n"Felix Bourbon-Parma, the brother of the Emperor\'s wife Zita, and thus a Habsburg relative, served in Przemysl. From the garrison he knew Ukrainians and the Ukrainian problem. As a relative of the Habsburgs and having memories of his youth in Galicia, he often came to Lviv and to Berehynia Forest for hunting. It was here that he initiated the acquaintance and friendship with Mr. Melnyk. That is why Colonel Melnyk was able to settle in Luxembourg so easily after the war ended." [^source39] \n\nMeanwhile, Sofia\'s family faced new challenges. On January 6, 1937, her father, Stepan Fedak, suddenly died. A year before his death, he had prepared a will, according to which his wife, Maria Sichynsky, was appointed the "universal heiress" of all the family\'s property. \n\nThe lawyer appointed his daughter Sofia as the second main heir, provided that "she would not keep the property for herself, but would give it to those in her family who would need it when they needed it." [^source40] \n\nMaria Fedak endured her husband\'s death with great fortitude, but told her family that "I will not have any holidays because of my grandfather\'s death." [^source41] \n\nAs the newspaper Dilo wrote, "...a grand memorial service on January 9, 1937, with the participation of 25 clergymen and citizens blocked the movement of the main artery of Lviv and ended with the burial of S. Fedak in Lychakiv without speeches, wreaths, or flowers, in view of the last will of the deceased" [^source42]. \n\nIn May 1938, Yevhen Konovalets was assassinated in Rotterdam by a Soviet secret service agent. Since February 1929, he had been the head of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which was proclaimed in Vienna as an underground movement to unite pro-Ukrainian groups that had been scattered after the war. \n\nAt first, Andriy Melnyk was the executor of its special tasks, and from the beginning of 1937 he began to act as the organization\'s treasurer. In his will for the OUN, Colonel Konovalets appointed Colonel Melnyk, whom he trusted the most, as his successor as head of the organization in the event of his death. So the Melnyks had to take on this heavy responsibility. \n\nIn September 1938, they left for Berlin and never returned to their homeland. \n\nIn general, it can be summarized that this short period of relatively peaceful and tranquil life was marked by happy moments, as well as serious shocks and heavy losses for Olena Fedak\'s family. Her niece, who was born in late 1917 and spent a lot of time under the care of her grandmother due to her parents\' constant employment, later recalled: "My childhood in the Fedak family was neither cheerful nor simple... It was constantly associated with some kind of danger, cowards, arrests, escapes abroad, and political trials in which our family members were also defendants, and my grandfather, Dr. Stepan Fedak, was the defense attorney..."

			'During the Second World War, Ukraine once again found itself in the epicenter of hostilities. Its territory, divided by 4 neighboring states, was additionally encroached upon by the right-wing radical governments of Hungary and Germany. On the other hand, the Soviet totalitarian regime was making plans to expand its borders by annexing western Ukrainian territories. Ukrainians once again found themselves in a state of fratricidal war, forced to fight against each other in the armies of the opposing sides. Thus, in the ranks of the Soviet army, mostly residents of the eastern, central, and southern regions of Ukraine fought. In the Polish army, which put up fierce resistance to the Wehrmacht at the beginning of the war, "one in five was a Ukrainian." At the same time, the Nazi army, which was advancing in Poland, had a "separate Ukrainian military unit." [^source44] .\n\nAt the same time, the Second World War triggered a new wave of national liberation movement of Ukrainian patriots, whose goal was to create an independent state. It is worth noting that most Ukrainians, after Stalin\'s "Great Terror" policy of 1936-1940, were deprived of the ability to put up much resistance to the regime. Nevertheless, in 1941, many greeted the Nazi troops as an army of "liberators", agreeing to cooperate with the new government for various reasons. Very quickly, Ukrainians had the opportunity to see that their reasoning was wrong and paid severely for it. According to Serhii Plokhy, "...those who had such hopes for the Germans soon became convinced of their falsity, often absolute groundlessness, regardless of the reasons that fueled their hopes for a better life under German occupation." [^source45].\n\nAlso, emigrant centers of nationalist forces were intensively preparing for a new stage of the struggle. Desperate for support from the former Triple Entente powers, which had ignored the "Ukrainian question" after the end of World War I, nationalist organizations sought support from the reactionary circles of the Nazi government in Germany. Despite the similarity of their ideologies, the German Nazis and Ukrainian nationalists had different goals, but tried to use each other to their advantage. However, this cooperation, as time has shown, was short-lived and led, among other things, to the split of the OUN in 1940. The leaders of both parts of the organization, Andriy Melnyk and Stepan Bandera, were imprisoned by the Nazis, and hundreds of OUN members were shot.\n\nThe Nazi occupation of Ukraine was accompanied by the Holocaust, which had terrible consequences for the population. As S. Plokhy aptly noted: "Ukraine under German occupation became a large-scale model of a concentration camp. As in the camps, the line between resistance and cooperation, the role of victim and complicity in the regime\'s crimes became blurred and invisible. Everyone made a personal choice, and the survivors had to live with their decisions after the war, some in harmony and some in pangs of conscience. But almost everyone suffered from guilt for surviving." [^source46]\n\nTo this day, Ukrainians are unable to cope with the division of their own history. The one-sided, ideologically driven coverage of the events of the Second World War, the demonization of the participants in the national liberation movement, and the failure to recognize and condemn the crimes of the totalitarian communist regime underscore the terrible consequences of the false historical narratives today.\n\nWhen the Wehrmacht troops occupied Luxembourg on 10.05.1940, the Grand Duchess and members of the government fled to France, and after its surrender, they created a government in exile, first in London and then in Montreal. From exile, the Grand Duchess Charlotte called on citizens to disobey the occupiers. As a result, a part of the adult population left the country, and many of them joined the French Resistance movement. In Luxembourg itself, the rejection of the occupation resulted in the unwillingness of citizens to be Wehrmacht soldiers, in the failure of the so-called language referendum organized by the Nazis in October 1941, when the vast majority of residents named Luxembourgish, not German, as their native language.\n\nUnlike the occupation during the First World War, during the Second World War, Nazi Germany pursued a policy of total assimilation, including the ban on the French language, the dissolution of political parties, the abolition of the Luxembourg state, and the introduction of universal military service.\n\nDuring the occupation in August 1942, the Germans attempted to annex the territory of the Grand Duchy directly to Hitler\'s Reich. In response, the population of the country resorted to a general strike, to which the Germans responded with mass repression. About 30 thousand Luxembourgers (more than 10% of the total population of the Duchy), most of whom were young men, were arrested and expelled from the country. Nevertheless, young people did not escape mobilization, and 2850 of them were killed on the Eastern Front. About 4,000 Luxembourgers were sent to concentration camps, and 400 people did not return from there. One third of the Luxembourg Jews were exterminated. The number of victims in relation to the total population puts Luxembourg in the first line of Western European countries affected by the war.\n\nIn September 1944, the Allied forces liberated Luxembourg and the government was able to return from exile to its homeland. However, during the offensive in the Ardennes, the northern regions of Luxembourg were again captured by German troops and finally liberated only in February 1945. In the postwar period, anti-German sentiment in Luxembourg was perhaps the most radical in the western part of the continent. The policy of denying the very existence of the Luxembourgers as a nation strengthened national identity. [^source47].'

			'According to open sources, international events on the eve of the war prompted Prince Felix to plan the possible emigration of the Grand Ducal family as early as 1939. He established the first contacts with U.S. President FDR and prepared the establishment of a Luxembourg mission in Washington. When the Wehrmacht violated Luxembourg\'s neutrality and invaded the country on May 10, 1940, the Grand Duchess, accompanied by her family and government, left for France. The Nazis offered her to stay in the country, promising to preserve her status, but she refused. Millions of refugees in today\'s world can relate to and understand the phrase Charlotte used to answer: "My heart says yes, but my mind says no." [^source48]\n\nAfter the surrender of France in June 1940, the Grand Ducal family went to Portugal, then, through the UK, to the United States, finally settling in Canada. The Duchess stayed in London for a while, rejoining her family in October of that year. While the children were safe enough to continue their education, their parents continued their wartime political activities, often risking their lives on transatlantic trips to the UK. Obviously, this difficult decision of the Duchess was dictated by concerns for the safety of her own family, for the reputation of the monarchy, and the lessons learned during the reign of Mary Adelaide.\n\nIt should be noted that the emigration of the ducal family was appropriate. The Nazis did not pay attention to titles and statuses in the persecution of their opponents. For example, Prince Felix\'s younger brother Luigi Bourbon-Parma was imprisoned with his family in the Nazi concentration camp Sachsenhausen. One of the older brothers, Xavier Bourbon-Parma, miraculously survived the Dachau concentration camp. Princess Antonia, the younger sister of the Grand Duchess Charlotte, returned home from there seriously ill after the war. She suffered because of the anti-Nazi views of her husband, Crown Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria. However, these facts became known to the public much later. And at the beginning of the war and during the occupation, when the population of any country is in dire need of protection and support, the government\'s emigration is perceived as a betrayal of national interests.\n\nNevertheless, throughout her exile, Charlotte remained the head of state as much as possible in the extremely difficult circumstances. In 1941, she visited Luxembourgish emigrant groups and associations in the United States. Over the next two years, she traveled the United States on so-called "Goodwill Tours." In 1943, she settled in London, from where she supported her people by speaking at the BBC radio. Witnesses to the events of the time claimed that in this way the Grand Duchess helped to strengthen the patriotic feelings of the Luxembourgers and their cohesion in opposing the invaders.\n\n[^source49]. The Grand Duchess Charlotte began each of her speeches with the words "Léif Lëtzebuerger" ("Dear Luxembourgers"), a phrase that later became the title of a documentary film by filmmaker Ray Tostevin about her five years in exile. Charlotte was the sovereign of the country, but beyond her duties, she personified a beautiful, elegant, and even maternal figure, as well as a hope for the people. She became "the symbol of the Luxembourg Resistance." [^source50].\n\nIt is worth noting that Luxembourgers had a mixed reaction to the monarch\'s flight. Even today, researchers continue to doubt the feasibility of such a step and look for good reasons to justify it. [^source51]\n\nOne of the key and fateful decisions of the Luxembourg government in exile was to join the anti-Hitler coalition from the moment it was created. Many officers of the former Luxembourg army fought alongside the Allies. In 1942, Prince Felix and Crown Prince Jean decided to join the British army as volunteers to liberate Luxembourg with the Allies. From November 1942, Prince Felix served in the British Army\'s Northern Command. The future Grand Duke Jean personally participated in the Allied landings in Normandy.\n\nClearly, the Grand Duchess was aware of all the consequences of her decision, which may be why she returned home before the war officially ended. The return to Luxembourg of the ducal family, headed by Charlotte, was greeted with enthusiasm.\n\n[^source52]. This heartbreaking footage shows that Luxembourgers were waiting for their duchess and rejoiced at her return home. In her first decree, the Grand Duchess ordered that all victims of the war be paid full compensation for material damage.\n\nDespite the obvious advantages of the existing form of government for Luxembourg in the past, and the undoubted merits of the Grand Ducal family in preserving the state during geopolitical upheavals, modern Luxembourgers often reflect on the monarchy. In particular, there is a discussion about the symbolism of the monarchy, the role of the monarch in history, the expediency of preserving this form of government, etc. The movie “Léif Lëtzebuerger” provoked particularly lively discussions.
