			INTRODUCTION: {
				CONTENT: [
					"Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People of creative professions perceive the world in a special way, and determine their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His “Yesterday's World,” which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is rather a biography of an entire generation that had to survive two world wars; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written while in exile on another continent. [^source1]"

				QUOTE: [
					'"...When I try to find a proper definition for the pre-World War I era in which I grew up, I think it would be more accurate to say that it was a golden age of reliability. Everything in our almost thousand-year old Austrian monarchy seemed to be designed to last forever, and the state was the ultimate guarantor of this permanence. The rights it provided to its citizens were enshrined in the parliament, this freely elected representative of the people, and every duty was strictly regulated. This touching conviction that one could build a palisade around oneself without leaving any loopholes for any intrusion of fate, was, for all its practicality and moderation, a fair amount of dangerous vanity.\n\nThe nineteenth century, in its liberal idealism, was sincerely convinced that it was on the straight and narrow path to the “best of all worlds.” It looked down on previous eras with their wars, famines, and turmoil as a time when humanity was still underaged and insufficiently educated. They believed in such relapses of barbarism as the wars between the peoples of Europe as little as they believed in witches and ghosts; our parents were convinced of the strength of the binding force of tolerance and friendliness. They sincerely believed that the boundaries and differences between nations and religions would gradually be erased in universal humanity, and that peace and security, the highest goods, were destined for all mankind...\n\n"'

				'CHARLOTTE LUXEMBOURG': {
					INTRODUCTION: [
						'It always seems to ordinary people that the life of monarchs resembles an interesting and vividly illustrated fairy tale. The biography of Princess Charlotte of Luxembourg dispels this myth. Her life story is like a drama, but with a happy ending. On the one hand, it was the life of an ordinary person, in which sadness and joy, happiness and suffering alternated. It was the life of a woman who had a loving family and home from birth, received an education, became a wife and mother of six children. At the same time, her life was regulated by her special status, which imposed certain responsibilities and limited her personal freedom. Given this, Charlotte had to show great ingenuity to cope with all the challenges and difficulties and to organize her life as she saw fit. It is extremely interesting to trace all the twists and turns of this complex but interesting personal story.\n\nThe Nassau dynasty was one of the oldest European noble families with great wealth and possessions. Princess Charlotte was born into this family on January 23, 1896. She was the second of six daughters in the family of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Luxembourg and his wife, Princess Maria Anna of Portugal of the Braganza dynasty.'

					SISTERS: [
						"The girl had an older sister, Maria Adelaide, and younger sisters, Hilda, Antoinette, Elizabeth, and Sofia. The country was ruled by her grandfather Adolf I. After his death in 1905, the princesses' father inherited the Luxembourg throne. Duke Wilhelm was worried that in the absence of an heir, his family might lose not only power but also their home."
					],
					INHERITANCE: [
						"Therefore, he did everything possible to keep his family in power. He managed to agree with the government on changes to the Nassau-Weilburg family charter. This meant that the Luxembourg princesses would have a preemptive right to the throne in the Grand Duchy in order of birth. It is worth noting that the Duke's worries were not in vain. Unexpectedly, a contender of Russian descent, Count Georg von Merenberg, a descendant of the Grand Duke's brother Adolf by a morganatic marriage with the daughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, declared his right to the throne.\n\nHowever, after a heated debate, the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies approved a law changing the succession to the throne in favor of princesses.[^source2]It should be noted that this was an extremely progressive decision. According to the rules of the time, women could not count on the regency or the throne. Monarchical power was inherited exclusively through the male line. Meanwhile, Count von Merenberg managed to pay off his claims with a substantial annual pension.\n\n"
					],
					DIFFICULTIES: [
						"Duke William was seriously ill from the moment he inherited the throne until the end of his life. His wife, Duchess Maria-Anne, took care of her seriously ill husband herself, so Charlotte and her sisters' childhood were not very happy. For example, the family was forced to move frequently because most of the existing residences were unsuitable for a comfortable life and their father's health. Under such conditions, the children were only able to receive a home education. Her initial course was supplemented with gymnastics, fencing, and English, German, and French lessons. In addition, the princesses learned to ride and swim. All other sciences were introduced to the children of the Grand Ducal family by a professor of philology, who for a long time shared with them the inconvenience of frequent travel.\n\n",
						"The lives of the princesses were strictly regulated and controlled, accompanied by various restrictions. The parliament, the government, church officials, and the press were closely monitoring all events in the life of the Archduke's family, taking into account his health. Thus, sisters Charlotte and Hilda were not allowed to celebrate their First Communion in a lavish manner, as was customary even in ordinary families. St. Michael's parish replied that “due to ‘certain circumstances’ this was not possible.” Therefore, the communion was held “quietly and modestly in the chapel of the Hohenburg Palace”...[^source3]\n\n",
						"Deprived of the opportunity to attend school, communicate freely with their peers, and grow up like ordinary children, the princesses were brought up in isolation, limited to their family circle, teachers, and governesses. Certainly, the experience of growing up with a seriously ill father and a mother exhausted by caring for him and his suffering was quite traumatic for the children of the Grand Ducal family. Also, the government and the general public were dissatisfied with the monarch's long absence from the country. Researchers noted the “alienation” of the ruling family, which eventually had critical consequences for the dynasty.\n\n"
					],
					SPECULATIONS: [
						"The governments of different countries used their ambassadors to monitor the behavior of the princesses. Where they traveled, where they stayed, who was part of their entourage, and so on. The newspapers described in detail the princesses' lives and various rumors related to their possible marriage. Moreover, statesmen discussed possible partners for the princesses' future marriages, which would be beneficial primarily to the state. Obviously, the excessive public attention that accompanied the princesses' lives contributed to the formation of their special character traits and the adoption of special behavioral patterns.\n\n"
					],
					ACTIVITY: {
						CONTENT: [
							"Princesses Mary Adelaide and Charlotte began their representative duties early on, given their difficult family circumstances. Because of Mary Adelaide's particular vulnerability, at her mother's request, Charlotte accompanied her sister everywhere, preparing to take over the monarch's duties if necessary. The sisters attracted attention by their opposites. Mary Adelaide was characterized by restraint, shyness, and piety. Charlotte, on the other hand, was cheerful and open. The proof can be found in the words of the German ambassador to Luxembourg, Count Schwerin, who described Charlotte in his report:\n\n",
							"Hunting was a popular pastime of the time. Unlike her older sister, Charlotte “showed a great passion” for this activity.[^source4] Obviously, Princess Mary Adelaide was not ready for the role of Grand Duchess. First of all, because she was too young and inexperienced when she lost her father and inherited the throne. The whole country, together with the Grand Duchess's family, had a hard time with his death in 1912.[^source5]\n\n",
							'The lavish funeral of her father, the oppressive atmosphere of mourning, and the burden of responsibility for the fate of the dynasty could not but affect the vulnerability of the main heiress. Her contemporaries testified to her aloofness, concentration, and manifestations of a strong, authoritarian character at that time. At the same time, Charlotte, being close to her sister, gained valuable experience that helped her in the future.'

						QUOTE: [
							'“The princess is as gifted as her older sister, but fortunately does not suffer from such embarrassment. She makes every effort to fulfill her official duties. But she feels much more comfortable in a private circle, where her lively, cheerful temperament comes through. Everyone praises her for her special, cordial kindness... this friendliness is the main feature of her character, and her very elegant appearance is in perfect harmony with it...”'

				'SOFIA FEDAK': {
					CHILDHOOD: [
						'In contrast, the childhood of another heroine of our project, Sofia Fedak, was calm and carefree. She was born in Lviv (at that time it was the territory of Austria-Hungary) on October 30, 1901, into an extraordinary family and was provided with everything she needed from childhood. Her father, Stepan Fedak, was a prominent Lviv jurist, lawyer, and one of the richest Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia. Some contemporary Ukrainian researchers call him “one of the then oligarchs of Austria-Hungary”.[^source5] His eldest daughter jokingly called herself “the daughter of a wealthy Lviv patrician”.[^source6]'
					],
					MOVEMENT: {
						CONTENT: [
							'It is worth noting that in the second half of the nineteenth century, Galicia became the center of the Ukrainian national movement, the so-called “Ukrainian Piedmont.” Oppressed and disenfranchised for a long time, Ukrainian peasants gradually realized the shamefulness of their situation, especially in comparison to other enslaved peoples of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Social protests were combined with political slogans that eventually became radicalized. Along with the demands for autonomy and universal suffrage, the idea of gaining independence was voiced. In the social aspect, the leadership of the Ukrainian national movement at the turn of the century gradually passed to secular intellectuals.',

							"However, Stepan Fedak tried to avoid politics and concentrated on his professional activities. He opened his own law office in Lviv, which provided legal assistance to both individuals and Ukrainian institutions. For some time, he headed the Union of Ukrainian Advocates, contributed to the establishment and operation of various Ukrainian financial and economic institutions, which were also centers of public life. The lawyers of Stepan Fedak's generation were vividly characterized by their contemporary, Ukrainian politician Lev Hankevych:\n\n",

							"Although categorically unwilling to engage in politics, Sofia's father, Stepan Fedak, nevertheless proved himself to be an active figure in the social and political life of Galicia. According to researchers of his activities, “among the Ukrainian elite of the region at the time, the figure tried in every possible way to abstract himself from political activity, but he did not always succeed.” [^source5]\n\n",

							"Being a strong and even authoritarian man in any matters related to his professional interests, Stepan Fedak left the house and upbringing of his children entirely to his wife Maria Fedak-Sichynska, who came from a Greek Catholic priest's family, where morality and religiosity traditionally reigned supreme. Maria's father, Father Lukian Sichynsky, was a cousin of one of the most famous Ukrainian politicians, Oleksandr Barvinsky, and the girl's mother, Natalia Brylynska, was the sister of the famous lawyer Yevhen Olesnytsky, who introduced the young couple.\n\n"

							'“...This is a new generation of Ukrainian palestra. These are no longer “defenders of the gentry, bourgeoisie, and industrialists,” but defenders of the entire nation. All of them are already nationally conscious, people of European culture...'

					},
					MARRIAGE: {
						CONTENT: [
							"An interesting fact is that in the Uniate Church of Galicia, the marriage oath was as follows: a woman swore to her husband to love, fidelity, and obedience, and he swore to her to love and fidelity. Despite the patriarchal upbringing that determined the future education of a Galician girl within the family, household, church, and child-rearing, Sofia's mother was active in the women's educational movement in Galicia."
						],
						QUOTE: [
							'“Mrs. Maria, a small woman, always calm, unspoken, kept the house on Sykstuska Street in Lviv in exemplary order with a strong hand and took care of the decent upbringing of all eight children. And the children were brought up as conscious Ukrainians, participating in the political life of their land...”'
						]
					},
					EQUALITY: [
						"Maria was one of the first to focus on the role of women in society. According to archival data, Mariia Fedak had the right to participate (together with her husband) in the election of deputies to the Lviv City Council for the period from 1913-1914.[^source8] This detail shows the equality of S. Fedak's wife not only in the home but also in public affairs. It is not surprising that the children were brought up as conscious Ukrainians, taking an active part in the political life of their land. There were 8 children in the family: daughters Halyna (Olena), Olha, Mariia, Sofia, Oksana, Daria, and sons Stefan-Jaroslav and Bohdan.\n\n",

						"Sofia's parents maintained friendly relations with such famous families in Lviv at the time as the Shukhevychs, Nahirni, and Levytski. They also visited Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky and Ivan Franko, with whom Stepan Fedak was connected through publishing and friendly relations. At the turn of 1921-1922, the well-known organizer and leader of the Ukrainian women's movement, teacher and literary critic Sofia Rusova lived in the Fedak household for some time. The young Roman Shukhevych (the future leader of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army), who was a brilliant storyteller and virtuoso pianist, repeatedly visited the Fedak house for youth meetings, attracting the attention of all the girls present, including those from the host's family.\n\n",

						"Sofia's niece, Olha Kuzmovych, described the traditions of the Fedak family in an extremely vivid way in her memoirs of her childhood years spent in her grandparents' home. She recalled that in the courtyard of the Fedak family home there was a separate room for “mademoiselle.” A governess lived there and taught the family's children German and French. There was also a watchman who guarded the house and locked the heavy metal “brama” (gate) at night, making the house seem like a reliable fortress. [^source9] Her memoirs reveal a whole world of a wealthy Lviv family with detailed descriptions of everyday life, traditions, and customs. Particularly touching are the memories of Christmas, which was celebrated in the Fedak family with great fanfare, observing the traditional rite.\n\n"
					],

					TENSION: [
						"The example of the Fedak family illustrates the impact of global political events on the everyday life of Galician Ukrainians. In particular, Sofia's older sister Olena recalled how her parents discussed the resonant event that took place on April 12, 1908—the assassination of the governor of Galicia, Andrzej Potocki, by a student of Lviv University, Myroslav Sichynskyi. Sichynsky was a relative of Maria Fedak, and she “as the greatest ‘revolutionary’ of us all was outraged by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky's condemnation of this act”.[^source10]",

						"This example demonstrates the high level of tension in Ukrainian society at the time. When an educated woman from a traditional patriarchal family, a civic activist who was widely involved in charity work, actually approved of the terrorist attack. And she expected a similar reaction from the metropolitan of the Greek Catholic Church.\n\nAt the same time, her husband considered Sheptytsky's statement a “political tactic.” Stepan Fedak “by his nature was inclined to live in harmony with everyone and reconcile everyone rather than to fight with opponents of other views” [^source10]. It is also known that after 3 years of imprisonment, Myroslav escaped from prison and emigrated to the United States via Western Europe. Researchers claim that his rescue was organized and financed by the family of Stepan Fedak.[^source12]",

						"In addition, Olena Fedak described in detail the leisure activities of her parents' family. The children attended all the children's parties in the city, concerts and performances in Ukrainian and Polish theaters. In winter, they skated on a frozen pond, and in summer they went swimming and played tennis. Vacations were spent either in the Ukrainian Carpathians (Kosiv, Yaremche, Vorokhta) or abroad (Belgium, Switzerland). For the then 20-year-old Olena, the prewar year remained in her memories as “one big leisure time: dances, balls, home ‘fife’ (tea parties), theater, concerts, parties...” [^source10]"
