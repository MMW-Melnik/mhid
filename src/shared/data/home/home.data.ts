			INTRODUCTION: {
				CONTENT:
					"Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People of creative professions perceive the world in a special way, and determine their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His “Yesterday's World,” which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is rather a biography of an entire generation that had to survive two world wars; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written while in exile on another continent.

				QUOTE:
					'"...When I try to find a proper definition for the pre-World War I era in which I grew up, I think it would be more accurate to say that it was a golden age of reliability. Everything in our almost thousand-year old Austrian monarchy seemed to be designed to last forever, and the state was the ultimate guarantor of this permanence. The rights it provided to its citizens were enshrined in the parliament, this freely elected representative of the people, and every duty was strictly regulated. This touching conviction that one could build a palisade around oneself without leaving any loopholes for any intrusion of fate, was, for all its practicality and moderation, a fair amount of dangerous vanity.\n\n The nineteenth century, in its liberal idealism, was sincerely convinced that it was on the straight and narrow path to the “best of all worlds.” It looked down on previous eras with their wars, famines, and turmoil as a time when humanity was still underaged and insufficiently educated. They believed in such relapses of barbarism as the wars between the peoples of Europe as little as they believed in witches and ghosts; our parents were convinced of the strength of the binding force of tolerance and friendliness. They sincerely believed that the boundaries and differences between nations and religions would gradually be erased in universal humanity, and that peace and security, the highest goods, were destined for all mankind..."'
