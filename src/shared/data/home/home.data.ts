				CONTENT: [
					"Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People of creative professions perceive the world in a special way, and determine their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His “Yesterday's World,” which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is rather a biography of an entire generation that had to survive two world wars; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written while in exile on another continent.

				QUOTE: [
					'"...When I try to find a proper definition for the pre-World War I era in which I grew up, I think it would be more accurate to say that it was a golden age of reliability. Everything in our almost thousand-year old Austrian monarchy seemed to be designed to last forever, and the state was the ultimate guarantor of this permanence. The rights it provided to its citizens were enshrined in the parliament, this freely elected representative of the people, and every duty was strictly regulated. This touching conviction that one could build a palisade around oneself without leaving any loopholes for any intrusion of fate, was, for all its practicality and moderation, a fair amount of dangerous vanity.\n\nThe nineteenth century, in its liberal idealism, was sincerely convinced that it was on the straight and narrow path to the “best of all worlds.” It looked down on previous eras with their wars, famines, and turmoil as a time when humanity was still underaged and insufficiently educated. They believed in such relapses of barbarism as the wars between the peoples of Europe as little as they believed in witches and ghosts; our parents were convinced of the strength of the binding force of tolerance and friendliness. They sincerely believed that the boundaries and differences between nations and religions would gradually be erased in universal humanity, and that peace and security, the highest goods, were destined for all mankind...\n\n"'

					INTRODUCTION: [
						'It always seems to ordinary people that the life of monarchs resembles an interesting and vividly illustrated fairy tale. The biography of Princess Charlotte of Luxembourg dispels this myth. Her life story is like a drama, but with a happy ending. On the one hand, it was the life of an ordinary person, in which sadness and joy, happiness and suffering alternated. It was the life of a woman who had a loving family and home from birth, received an education, became a wife and mother of six children. At the same time, her life was regulated by her special status, which imposed certain responsibilities and limited her personal freedom. Given this, Charlotte had to show great ingenuity to cope with all the challenges and difficulties and to organize her life as she saw fit. It is extremely interesting to trace all the twists and turns of this complex but interesting personal story.\n\nThe Nassau dynasty was one of the oldest European noble families with great wealth and possessions. Princess Charlotte was born into this family on January 23, 1896. She was the second of six daughters in the family of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Luxembourg and his wife, Princess Maria Anna of Portugal of the Braganza dynasty.'
