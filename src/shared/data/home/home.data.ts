			title: 'LATE NINETEENTH - EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY. A PREMONITION OF WAR',
			text: "Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People of creative professions perceive the world in a special way, and determine their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His “Yesterday's World,” which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is rather a biography of an entire generation that had to survive two world wars; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written while in exile on another continent [^source1][^source2]"

			title: 'WORLD WAR II ',
			quote:
				'“Before the First World War, the Austrian monarchy was characterised by a sense of stability and reliability, where rights were fixed and duties were regulated. People believed that the world was on the way to a better future, where wars and conflicts would gradually disappear, giving way to peace and security.”',
