				TITLE: 'GROWING UP IN BELLE EPOQUE',
				INTRODUCTION: [
					"Any era is subtly reflected in its literature. People in creative professions have a special way of perceiving the world and defining their own place in it. For example, the famous Austrian writer Stefan Zweig described the events of the early and mid-twentieth century quite vividly. His Yesterday's World, which can be easily extrapolated to the modern world, leaves no illusions. The book is largely autobiographical, but it is also an account of an entire generation that saw their world crumble; it is a kind of hymn to Europe written by an exile on another continent, sent to his publisher in February 1942 – two days before his suicide."

						'"… If I try to find some useful phrase to sum up the time of my childhood and youth before the First World War, I hope I can put it most succinctly by calling it the Golden Age of Security… But for all the sobriety of people’s concept of life at the time, there was a dangerous and overweening pride in this touching belief that they could fence in their existence, leaving no gaps at all. People no more believed in the possibility of barbaric relapses, such as wars between the nations of Europe, than they believed in ghosts and witches; our fathers were doggedly convinced of the infallibly binding power of tolerance and conciliation. They honestly thought gradually to flow into a sense of common humanity, so that peace and security, the greatest of goods, would come to all mankind…"',

						'It always seems to ordinary people that the life of monarchs resembles a vividly illustrated fairy tale. The biography of Princess Charlotte of Luxembourg comforts this myth. Her life story is like a drama, but with a happy ending. On the one hand, it was the life of an ordinary person, in which sadness and joy, happiness and suffering alternated. It was the life of a woman whose father died early and was raised by her mother – together with her five sisters. At the same time, her life was regulated by her special status, which imposed certain responsibilities and limited her personal freedom.'

						"The country was ruled by her grandfather Adolphe I. After his death in 1905, the princesses' father inherited the Luxembourg throne. Grand Duke Wilhelm was worried that in the absence of a male heir, his family might lose not only power but also their home. Therefore, he managed to agree with the government on changes to the Nassau-Weilburg family charter. This meant that the Luxembourg princesses would have a preemptive right to the throne of the Grand Duchy in order of birth. It is worth noting that the Duke's worries were not in vain. Unexpectedly, a contender of Russian descent, Count Georg von Merenberg, a descendant of the Grand Duke's brother Adolf by a morganatic marriage with the daughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, declared his right to the throne. However, after a heated debate, the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies approved a law changing the succession to the throne in favor of princesses.

The lives of the princesses were strictly regulated and controlled, accompanied by various restrictions. Parliament, the government, church officials, and the press were closely monitoring all events in the life of the monarch’s family, taking into account his health.

			CHAPTER2: {
				TITLE: 'WORLD WAR I',
				INTRODUCTION: [
					"For Ukraine, the First World War was a tragedy. Because there was no common state, Ukrainians were forced to fight against each other in the armies of the warring parties. Millions of Ukrainians died for someone else's interests, and these interests were hypothetical even for the leaders of the Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires, who ruled over Ukrainian lands, at the time. At the same time, it is important to know that in the course of this war (1918), Ukraine briefly gained independence, an important historical experience that fueled later resentment and a quest for revenge. The national liberation struggle in Ukraine during the Great War gave rise to future fighters for the independence of the Ukrainian people. [Serhii Plokhy. The Gates of Europe. A History of Ukraine from the Scythian Wars to Independence. KSD, 2016, pp. 66-67. Available online: https://readukrainianbooks.com/] Meanwhile, Luxembourg also experienced serious upheaval. Contrary to international law, which was supposed to ensure Luxembourg's 'eternal' neutrality, the country was occupied by German troops. The German government ignored diplomatic protests. Officially, the occupation of Luxembourg was not considered hostile: the state and local administration remained intact, and political life continued. However, the German military authorities constantly interfered in the governance of the state. Thousands of Luxembourgers volunteered for the French Foreign Legion. [https://hdl.handle.net/10993/48662] The paradox was that the then German Emperor Wilhelm II was an uncle to the Luxembourg princesses. Grand Duchess Maria-Adelaide may have tried to preserve the country's independence by meeting with Wilhelm II in Luxembourg during his visit to the Western Front. On the advice of the Minister of State, an unofficial secret meeting was arranged, but the information was leaked to French newspapers. [Pol Weitz. Charlotte von Luxemburg: ein Lebensbild. Druckerei J.M. Watgen, Luxemburg, 1990, S. 212-213] The Grand Duchess's actions seriously damaged Luxembourg's reputation in France. In addition, she tried to impose her political views which led to many cabinet reshuffles and profound resentment of the liberal elites. After a short-lived Republic, suppressed by the French occupation army, Marie-Adelaide abdicated in favor of her younger sister, Charlotte."

					"The situation of Ukrainians was complicated by the fact that the central and eastern Ukrainian lands were part of Soviet Russia and experienced all the consequences of the totalitarian Bolshevik regime. While the western Ukrainian territories, divided between Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, had a different experience. This solution to the 'Ukrainian question'  had severe consequences for the Ukrainian people. While for most European countries, this short period meant a return to peaceful life, it remains in the collective memory of Ukrainians as a period characterized by repression and genocide by the Soviet regime, and by the Polish government's harsh chauvinistic assimilation policy, which was accompanied by deportations of the population and oppression of the Ukrainian language and church. A similar anti-Ukrainian policy, albeit in a somewhat milder form, was pursued by the governments of Romania and Czechoslovakia, respectively, in relation to Bukovyna and Zakarpattia. Such a rigid and sometimes brutal policy made Ukrainians perceive the new governments as occupying powers and provoked active resistance. Residents of the western part of Ukraine resisted especially hard fiercely, using both legal and underground methods of struggle. This included terror as strategy. Throughout the stateless period, the interests of Ukrainians in the world were represented by Ukrainian emigrants."

During this difficult period for the family, Sofia studied at the Trade Academy in Vienna. After graduating in 1923, she worked at the Audit Union of Ukrainian Cooperatives in Lviv. In 1924, she got engaged to Andriy Melnyk. It is likely that Andriy Melnyk was introduced to the Fedak family, similar to Metropolitan Sheptytsky, by another well-known Ukrainian politician and public figure, Yevhen Olesnytskiy,  Maria Fedak's uncle. Olesnytskiy had taken care of Andriy from the time he studied at the Striy  Gymnasium.

						"Sofia went to the prison with packages to her fiancé every day for four years. It is also known that it was thanks to Andriy Melnyk that Yevhen Konovalets met and later married Olga Fedak.

After the end of his imprisonment, Andriy was able to marry Sofia. The wedding took place on February 28, 1929, in the chapel of the Theological Seminary in Lviv. The couple had no children. Perhaps this was the result of the torture he suffered in Russian and Polish captivity.

This tradition continued after the war. Melnyk, who had a university degree and spoke foreign languages, met 'high' guests with whom he could easily communicate. The memoirs of one of Melnyk's future political associates reveal an interesting detail, possibly heard from the colonel himself, about his acquaintance with Prince Felix, the Consort of Luxembourg.
