				'In the interwar period, the territory of Ukraine was divided between 4 neighboring states. \nThe situation of Ukrainians was complicated by the fact that the central and eastern Ukrainian lands were part of Soviet Russia and experienced all the consequences of the totalitarian Bolshevik regime. \nThe western Ukrainian territories, divided between Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, had a different experience. \n\nSuch an ill-considered solution by world politicians to the "Ukrainian question," which was relevant to international relations at the time, had severe consequences for the Ukrainian people. \nFor most European countries, this short period of return to peaceful life was imprinted in the collective memory of Ukrainians by repression and genocide by the Soviet regime and by the Polish government\'s harsh chauvinistic assimilation policy, which was accompanied by deportations of the population and attacks on the Ukrainian language and church. \nA similar anti-Ukrainian policy, albeit in a somewhat milder form, was pursued by the governments of Romania and Czechoslovakia, respectively, in relation to Bukovina and Transcarpathia (Zakarpattia). \n\nIt is quite understandable that such a rigid and sometimes brutal policy made Ukrainians perceive the new government as an occupying power and provoked active resistance. \nIn particular, the residents of the western part of Ukraine opposed it strongly, using both legal and underground methods of struggle, including terror. \n\nThroughout the stateless period, the interests of Ukrainians in the world were represented by the Ukrainian diaspora. \nThe main flow of political emigration occurred in the early 1920s. \nResearchers claim that "in 1921 the number of Ukrainian immigrants in Western European countries reached almost 100 thousand people." [^source26] \n\nA significant part of the emigrants were members of the national liberation movement who did not want to accept defeat and continued to fight for Ukraine\'s independence. \nAmong the political emigrants in Vienna, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was created in 1929 and was headed by Yevhen Konovalets. \n\nFounded as an underground patriotic movement, the OUN quickly became a powerful force. \nIn 1933, it was legalized in Ukraine as a public organization. \nThe OUN led the Ukrainian resistance movement, first to the Polish, then to the Soviet, and later to the Nazi occupation authorities. \nThe organization operated mainly in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia, as well as in exile. \n\nAiming to establish an independent, united Ukrainian state, the organization relied on right-wing radical ideology and practice, which made it similar to similar political movements in Europe at the time. \n\nIt should be noted that the liberation movement in Ukraine was not homogeneous either. \nThere were various underground groups and organizations that, for various reasons, could not unite their efforts to achieve a single goal and were often at odds with each other. \n\nThe end of the war did not bring peace to Luxembourg either. \nAfter the signing of the Armistice of Compiègne, the country was gripped by revolutionary fever. \nThe workers\' and peasants\' council, supported by the crowd, demanded the overthrow of the monarchy and the proclamation of a republic. \n\nThe newly formed French League also wanted to establish a republic in Luxembourg under the protection of French sovereignty. \nBelgium put forward its own territorial claims. \nThe fate of the dynasty hung in the balance. \n\nAt this difficult time, the Grand Duchess proposed a referendum in which the people would choose the form of government. \nIt should be noted that Maria-Adelaide was characterized by a special "mystical state of mind" from childhood, and in her youth she decided that she would never marry and that "Lottie should rule" [^source27]. \n\nTherefore, she did not hold on to power and decided to abdicate in favor of her sister. \n\nThe short but eventful and tragically completed biography of Grand Duchess Maria Adelaide is thoroughly reflected in the work of Dr. Josiane Weber. \nHer research, based on historical sources, balances the imbalance of the Grand Duchess\'s political role and her importance in the history of Luxembourg [^source28]. \n\nA summary of the research results is presented in the researcher\'s lecture (in German). \n[^source29].',

				'Princess Charlotte became the head of state on January 15, 1919. However, gaining power was not easy. She had to fight for the throne. \n\nThe diplomatic situation threatened Charlotte with the loss of power and the state with the loss of independence. Difficult negotiations with the French government resulted in an agreement to grant Charlotte the duchy on the condition that she marries Felix, who held the title of French Bourbon. Thus, it can be stated that the title of Prince Felix saved the Duchy from losing its independence. \n\nThe referendum ensured internal stability. On September 28, 1919, almost 80% of the population of Luxembourg voted in favor of preserving the monarchy headed by the Grand Duchess Charlotte. \n\nAt the same time, a constitution was adopted that declared the nation sovereign and clearly regulated the powers of the monarch. It is worth noting that the monarchy was saved by women, who were granted the right to vote for the first time on the eve of the referendum. Until that time, the female population of the Duchy had no influence on political life, but they had always unofficially supported the "princesses of Berg Castle," sympathizing with them and criticizing government officials. [^source30] \n\nThe former princess\'s personal life was also full of surprises. In particular, the vicissitudes of the marriage of the Grand Duchess Charlotte and Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma deserve special attention. \n\nIt is clear that their engagement and wedding were the subject of increased public attention. This is confirmed by numerous archival publications and photographs. However, the peculiarity of the status of monarchs is that public interest in their private lives is not limited to chronological timeframes. \n\nFrom the memoirs of the American Papal Privy Counselor (Chamberlain) [^source31] Francis Augustus MacNutt, it became known that this marriage was concluded by proxy and out of the public eye on March 24, 1919, in Switzerland at the Wartegg Castle. \n\nIf we take into account the civil wedding ceremony that took place on the morning of November 6th of the same year in the Grand Ducal Palace of Luxembourg, it turns out that Charlotte married three times to the same man. The details of Charlotte and Felix\'s first (secret) wedding ceremony became known over time from eyewitness accounts, as did the reasons for it. \n\nPrince Felix could not come to Luxembourg, but he had documents that allowed him to marry. One of the witnesses was the Austrian Emperor Charles (Felix\'s brother-in-law). The bride was represented by her sister Maria Adelheid. Perhaps such secrets were due to the peculiarities of marriage between relatives. \n\nThis required special permission from the Pope, which Prince Felix managed to obtain. Difficulties also arose in Charlotte\'s homeland. The Luxembourgers were wary of the future prince, who had fought in an enemy coalition. The public was also concerned about the presence of feelings between the newlyweds. By the way, this question still interests researchers of the Grand Ducal family. [^source32] \n\nHowever, the young couple overcame all obstacles. Obviously, they were helped by influential relatives, friends, and officials interested in establishing stability. It was during this relatively calm interwar period that the couple had six children: Jean, Elizabeth, Marie-Adelaide, Marie-Gabrielle, Charles, and Alix. \n\nThe whole country celebrated the birth of their first child, the heir to the throne. In response to the congratulations, Charlotte said a phrase that became a catchphrase: "Ich dien" ("I serve"). [^source33] \n\nIt is worth noting that by giving birth to a son and choosing a common name for him, the Grand Duchess won the "battle" with the opponents of the monarchy, significantly strengthening the throne. Prince Jean became the first male heir to the throne born on Luxembourg\'s soil. In traditional societies, such things have always been of great importance and had important political consequences. \n\nThe dynastic issue became irrelevant, and the enemies of the Grand Ducal House were pacified. However, the happy life was overshadowed by a new war.',

				'The Riga Peace Treaty of 1921 recognized Poland\'s right to Eastern Galicia. This ill-considered decision of the Entente countries, aggravated by various types of discrimination by the restored Polish state, caused active resistance among Western Ukrainians. \n\nThe Polish authorities were perceived as occupiers, so they tried to get rid of them by any means necessary, using both legal and underground methods of struggle that included terror. This situation arose quite naturally. \n\nThe participants of the national liberation struggle who survived the hell of war, refusing to accept the defeat of their idea, tried to take revenge on those who were lucky enough to be in the victorious camp. Later, after realizing that there were no prospects for continuing the struggle, most of its participants left their homeland. \n\nA typical example of a Ukrainian of this era was Stepan Fedak, Sofia\'s brother, who joined the Ukrainian Insurgent Army at the age of 14 and fought in the Ukrainian Galician Army. Fedak was a member of the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), created by Yevhen Konovalets, and became famous for his assassination attempt of the head of the Polish state, Józef Piłsudski, in September 1921. \n\nA Polish court sentenced the young man to six years in prison, but he was released in 1924 and left the country. It is known that after this arrest, Stepan\'s mother, the calm "Mamunka" (as Maria Fedak was affectionately called by her family), quietly but firmly stated after a nighttime search of the house: "I am proud that it was my son who fulfilled this attentat." [^source34] \n\nThis position of a woman who approved of her son\'s terrorist attack reflects the mood of the majority of society. At the same time, Stepan\'s actions had unpleasant consequences for other family members. In particular, his father, Stepan Fedak (senior), made every effort to reach an understanding with the new government and reconcile the opponents. \n\nAccording to his contemporaries, he belonged to the conservative wing of Ukrainian politicians who hoped to achieve the desired result through negotiations, and was "more inclined to live in harmony with everyone and reconcile everyone than to fight with opponents of other views." [^source35] \n\nAt the same time, Dr. Fedak\'s words that "Poles and Ukrainians are people, and people can find common ground" [^source36] did not find support among young people of that time. This fact proves the differences in political views between representatives of different generations, which has been observed more than once in the public life of Ukrainians. \n\nAfter the attack, Dr. Fedak was arrested and spent 2 months in prison. His eldest daughter Olena recalled that "the whole Fedak family felt the consequences of the atentat." [^source37] \n\nIn particular, her husband, Lev Sheparovych, lost his job, they were forced to leave Lviv and moved to Germany for several years. During this difficult period for the family, Sofia studied at the Trade Academy in Vienna. After graduating in 1923, she worked at the Audit Union of Ukrainian Cooperatives in Lviv. From 1924, she was the bride of Andriy Melnyk. In the same year, he was sentenced by the Polish authorities to four years in prison for underground pro-Ukrainian activities. \n\nSofia went to the prison with packages to her fiancé every day for four years. It is not known for certain where the young couple met. Perhaps it happened on a train to Vienna, where they both received higher education and often traveled from home to study. This simple way of meeting was quite common among Ukrainian students. \n\nIt is also likely that Andriy Melnyk was introduced to the Fedak family, as well as Metropolitan Sheptytsky, by a well-known Ukrainian politician and public figure, Yevhen Olesnytskyi, who was Sofia\'s mother\'s uncle. Olesnytsky began to take care of Andriy from the time he studied at the Stryi Gymnasium. It is also known that it was thanks to Andriy Melnyk that Yevhen Konovalets met and later married Olena Fedak. \n\nAs the leader of an underground pro-Ukrainian organization (UVO), it was dangerous for Konovalets to remain in Ukraine. In December 1922, his wife and he emigrated to the West. They lived in exile in various European countries until the end of their lives, and Yevhen Konovalets never stopped searching for new methods of fighting for Ukraine\'s independence. \n\nAfter the end of their imprisonment, Andriy and Sofia were able to marry. The wedding took place on February 28, 1929, in the chapel of the Theological Seminary in Lviv. The couple had no children. Andriy Melnyk did not like to show off his personal family life and forbade his supporters to write about it. \n\nPerhaps this was the result of the torture he suffered in Russian captivity and the Polish prison. Melnyk later recalled his time in the Polish prison: "they beat me so much that it reached the League of Nations" [^source38] \n\nLawyer S. Fedak was involved in this publicity. In September 1925, he participated in the trial of a case of beating prisoners in a Lviv prison, where his son-in-law, a member of the UVO, A. Melnyk, was also held at the time. The lawyer ensured that the matter was considered by the Polish Sejm and that a note of protest was sent to the League of Nations, as well as that the horrific incident was widely covered in the domestic and foreign press. \n\nSofia and Andriy wanted to develop their family in their native Galicia. Sofia continued her work at the Audit Union and, together with her mother and sisters, initiated the creation of the Ukrainian Society of Women with Higher Education, which promoted the ideas of Ukrainian feminism. \n\nDespite the intense military and revolutionary life, Colonel Melnyk managed to complete his education in Vienna and receive his diploma. After the war, he began working as a forestry engineer in the estates of the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. These forests were famous far beyond the borders of Galicia. \n\nIt is known that at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries European aristocrats came to the Carpathians to hunt deer. In particular, Ukrainian archives contain references and photographs of Archduke Rudolf of Habsburg-Lorraine, Archduke Miguel of Braganza, and Archduchess Maria Theresa, daughter of the King of Portugal, hunting in Zakarpattia (Transcarpathia). This tradition continued after the war. \n\nMelnyk, who had a university degree and spoke foreign languages, met "high" guests with whom he could easily communicate. The memoirs of one of Melnyk\'s future political associates reveal an interesting detail, possibly heard from the colonel himself, about his acquaintance with Prince Felix, the Consort of Luxembourg. \n\n"Felix Bourbon-Parma, the brother of the Emperor\'s wife Zita, and thus a Habsburg relative, served in Przemysl. From the garrison he knew Ukrainians and the Ukrainian problem. As a relative of the Habsburgs and having memories of his youth in Galicia, he often came to Lviv and to Berehynia Forest for hunting. It was here that he initiated the acquaintance and friendship with Mr. Melnyk. That is why Colonel Melnyk was able to settle in Luxembourg so easily after the war ended." [^source39] \n\nMeanwhile, Sofia\'s family faced new challenges. On January 6, 1937, her father, Stepan Fedak, suddenly died. A year before his death, he had prepared a will, according to which his wife, Maria Sichynsky, was appointed the "universal heiress" of all the family\'s property. \n\nThe lawyer appointed his daughter Sofia as the second main heir, provided that "she would not keep the property for herself, but would give it to those in her family who would need it when they needed it." [^source40] \n\nMaria Fedak endured her husband\'s death with great fortitude, but told her family that "I will not have any holidays because of my grandfather\'s death." [^source41] \n\nAs the newspaper Dilo wrote, "...a grand memorial service on January 9, 1937, with the participation of 25 clergymen and citizens blocked the movement of the main artery of Lviv and ended with the burial of S. Fedak in Lychakiv without speeches, wreaths, or flowers, in view of the last will of the deceased" [^source42]. \n\nIn May 1938, Yevhen Konovalets was assassinated in Rotterdam by a Soviet secret service agent. Since February 1929, he had been the head of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which was proclaimed in Vienna as an underground movement to unite pro-Ukrainian groups that had been scattered after the war. \n\nAt first, Andriy Melnyk was the executor of its special tasks, and from the beginning of 1937 he began to act as the organization\'s treasurer. In his will for the OUN, Colonel Konovalets appointed Colonel Melnyk, whom he trusted the most, as his successor as head of the organization in the event of his death. So the Melnyks had to take on this heavy responsibility. \n\nIn September 1938, they left for Berlin and never returned to their homeland. \n\nIn general, it can be summarized that this short period of relatively peaceful and tranquil life was marked by happy moments, as well as serious shocks and heavy losses for Olena Fedak\'s family. Her niece, who was born in late 1917 and spent a lot of time under the care of her grandmother due to her parents\' constant employment, later recalled: "My childhood in the Fedak family was neither cheerful nor simple... It was constantly associated with some kind of danger, cowards, arrests, escapes abroad, and political trials in which our family members were also defendants, and my grandfather, Dr. Stepan Fedak, was the defense attorney..."

				'During the Second World War, Ukraine once again found itself in the epicenter of hostilities. Its territory, divided by 4 neighboring states, was additionally encroached upon by the right-wing radical governments of Hungary and Germany. On the other hand, the Soviet totalitarian regime was making plans to expand its borders by annexing western Ukrainian territories. Ukrainians once again found themselves in a state of fratricidal war, forced to fight against each other in the armies of the opposing sides. Thus, in the ranks of the Soviet army, mostly residents of the eastern, central, and southern regions of Ukraine fought. In the Polish army, which put up fierce resistance to the Wehrmacht at the beginning of the war, "one in five was a Ukrainian." At the same time, the Nazi army, which was advancing in Poland, had a "separate Ukrainian military unit." [^source44] .\n\nAt the same time, the Second World War triggered a new wave of national liberation movement of Ukrainian patriots, whose goal was to create an independent state. It is worth noting that most Ukrainians, after Stalin\'s "Great Terror" policy of 1936-1940, were deprived of the ability to put up much resistance to the regime. Nevertheless, in 1941, many greeted the Nazi troops as an army of "liberators", agreeing to cooperate with the new government for various reasons. Very quickly, Ukrainians had the opportunity to see that their reasoning was wrong and paid severely for it. According to Serhii Plokhy, "...those who had such hopes for the Germans soon became convinced of their falsity, often absolute groundlessness, regardless of the reasons that fueled their hopes for a better life under German occupation." [^source45].\n\nAlso, emigrant centers of nationalist forces were intensively preparing for a new stage of the struggle. Desperate for support from the former Triple Entente powers, which had ignored the "Ukrainian question" after the end of World War I, nationalist organizations sought support from the reactionary circles of the Nazi government in Germany. Despite the similarity of their ideologies, the German Nazis and Ukrainian nationalists had different goals, but tried to use each other to their advantage. However, this cooperation, as time has shown, was short-lived and led, among other things, to the split of the OUN in 1940. The leaders of both parts of the organization, Andriy Melnyk and Stepan Bandera, were imprisoned by the Nazis, and hundreds of OUN members were shot.\n\nThe Nazi occupation of Ukraine was accompanied by the Holocaust, which had terrible consequences for the population. As S. Plokhy aptly noted: "Ukraine under German occupation became a large-scale model of a concentration camp. As in the camps, the line between resistance and cooperation, the role of victim and complicity in the regime\'s crimes became blurred and invisible. Everyone made a personal choice, and the survivors had to live with their decisions after the war, some in harmony and some in pangs of conscience. But almost everyone suffered from guilt for surviving." [^source46]\n\nTo this day, Ukrainians are unable to cope with the division of their own history. The one-sided, ideologically driven coverage of the events of the Second World War, the demonization of the participants in the national liberation movement, and the failure to recognize and condemn the crimes of the totalitarian communist regime underscore the terrible consequences of the false historical narratives today.\n\nWhen the Wehrmacht troops occupied Luxembourg on 10.05.1940, the Grand Duchess and members of the government fled to France, and after its surrender, they created a government in exile, first in London and then in Montreal. From exile, the Grand Duchess Charlotte called on citizens to disobey the occupiers. As a result, a part of the adult population left the country, and many of them joined the French Resistance movement. In Luxembourg itself, the rejection of the occupation resulted in the unwillingness of citizens to be Wehrmacht soldiers, in the failure of the so-called language referendum organized by the Nazis in October 1941, when the vast majority of residents named Luxembourgish, not German, as their native language.\n\nUnlike the occupation during the First World War, during the Second World War, Nazi Germany pursued a policy of total assimilation, including the ban on the French language, the dissolution of political parties, the abolition of the Luxembourg state, and the introduction of universal military service.\n\nDuring the occupation in August 1942, the Germans attempted to annex the territory of the Grand Duchy directly to Hitler\'s Reich. In response, the population of the country resorted to a general strike, to which the Germans responded with mass repression. About 30 thousand Luxembourgers (more than 10% of the total population of the Duchy), most of whom were young men, were arrested and expelled from the country. Nevertheless, young people did not escape mobilization, and 2850 of them were killed on the Eastern Front. About 4,000 Luxembourgers were sent to concentration camps, and 400 people did not return from there. One third of the Luxembourg Jews were exterminated. The number of victims in relation to the total population puts Luxembourg in the first line of Western European countries affected by the war.\n\nIn September 1944, the Allied forces liberated Luxembourg and the government was able to return from exile to its homeland. However, during the offensive in the Ardennes, the northern regions of Luxembourg were again captured by German troops and finally liberated only in February 1945. In the postwar period, anti-German sentiment in Luxembourg was perhaps the most radical in the western part of the continent. The policy of denying the very existence of the Luxembourgers as a nation strengthened national identity. [^source47].',

				'According to open sources, international events on the eve of the war prompted Prince Felix to plan the possible emigration of the Grand Ducal family as early as 1939. He established the first contacts with U.S. President FDR and prepared the establishment of a Luxembourg mission in Washington. When the Wehrmacht violated Luxembourg\'s neutrality and invaded the country on May 10, 1940, the Grand Duchess, accompanied by her family and government, left for France. The Nazis offered her to stay in the country, promising to preserve her status, but she refused. Millions of refugees in today\'s world can relate to and understand the phrase Charlotte used to answer: "My heart says yes, but my mind says no." [^source48]\n\nAfter the surrender of France in June 1940, the Grand Ducal family went to Portugal, then, through the UK, to the United States, finally settling in Canada. The Duchess stayed in London for a while, rejoining her family in October of that year. While the children were safe enough to continue their education, their parents continued their wartime political activities, often risking their lives on transatlantic trips to the UK. Obviously, this difficult decision of the Duchess was dictated by concerns for the safety of her own family, for the reputation of the monarchy, and the lessons learned during the reign of Mary Adelaide.\n\nIt should be noted that the emigration of the ducal family was appropriate. The Nazis did not pay attention to titles and statuses in the persecution of their opponents. For example, Prince Felix\'s younger brother Luigi Bourbon-Parma was imprisoned with his family in the Nazi concentration camp Sachsenhausen. One of the older brothers, Xavier Bourbon-Parma, miraculously survived the Dachau concentration camp. Princess Antonia, the younger sister of the Grand Duchess Charlotte, returned home from there seriously ill after the war. She suffered because of the anti-Nazi views of her husband, Crown Prince Ruprecht of Bavaria. However, these facts became known to the public much later. And at the beginning of the war and during the occupation, when the population of any country is in dire need of protection and support, the government\'s emigration is perceived as a betrayal of national interests.\n\nNevertheless, throughout her exile, Charlotte remained the head of state as much as possible in the extremely difficult circumstances. In 1941, she visited Luxembourgish emigrant groups and associations in the United States. Over the next two years, she traveled the United States on so-called "Goodwill Tours." In 1943, she settled in London, from where she supported her people by speaking at the BBC radio. Witnesses to the events of the time claimed that in this way the Grand Duchess helped to strengthen the patriotic feelings of the Luxembourgers and their cohesion in opposing the invaders.\n\n[^source49]. The Grand Duchess Charlotte began each of her speeches with the words "Léif Lëtzebuerger" ("Dear Luxembourgers"), a phrase that later became the title of a documentary film by filmmaker Ray Tostevin about her five years in exile. Charlotte was the sovereign of the country, but beyond her duties, she personified a beautiful, elegant, and even maternal figure, as well as a hope for the people. She became "the symbol of the Luxembourg Resistance." [^source50].\n\nIt is worth noting that Luxembourgers had a mixed reaction to the monarch\'s flight. Even today, researchers continue to doubt the feasibility of such a step and look for good reasons to justify it. [^source51]\n\nOne of the key and fateful decisions of the Luxembourg government in exile was to join the anti-Hitler coalition from the moment it was created. Many officers of the former Luxembourg army fought alongside the Allies. In 1942, Prince Felix and Crown Prince Jean decided to join the British army as volunteers to liberate Luxembourg with the Allies. From November 1942, Prince Felix served in the British Army\'s Northern Command. The future Grand Duke Jean personally participated in the Allied landings in Normandy.\n\nClearly, the Grand Duchess was aware of all the consequences of her decision, which may be why she returned home before the war officially ended. The return to Luxembourg of the ducal family, headed by Charlotte, was greeted with enthusiasm.\n\n[^source52]. This heartbreaking footage shows that Luxembourgers were waiting for their duchess and rejoiced at her return home. In her first decree, the Grand Duchess ordered that all victims of the war be paid full compensation for material damage.\n\nDespite the obvious advantages of the existing form of government for Luxembourg in the past, and the undoubted merits of the Grand Ducal family in preserving the state during geopolitical upheavals, modern Luxembourgers often reflect on the monarchy. In particular, there is a discussion about the symbolism of the monarchy, the role of the monarch in history, the expediency of preserving this form of government, etc. The movie “Léif Lëtzebuerger” provoked particularly lively discussions.
