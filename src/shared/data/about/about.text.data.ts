				"The war initiated by Russia against Ukraine in 2014 posed a challenge for all European countries. Nations not directly affected by the aggression faced a massive influx of Ukrainian migrants fleeing the war. This became a unique and further test for the democratic institutions of civilized countries. Luxembourg, with its tradition of peaceful coexistence among representatives of different cultures, once again hospitably welcomed thousands of migrants from Ukraine—a country unfamiliar to most of its residents. At the same time, for many Ukrainians, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg also remained a terra incognita.\n\nIn this context, there arose a need to introduce Ukrainians to Luxembourgish society through the prism of historical events. It was equally important to draw attention to Luxembourg's historical traditions of supporting political migrants and refugees, including those from Ukraine.\n\n",

				'This project, as an act of memorialization, honors women who devoted their lives to noble causes—serving their people, overcoming difficulties, and supporting their families. It focuses on two women from different countries, representatives of the same generation that survived two world wars. By exploring their life stories against the backdrop of global historical events, we can trace parallels and highlight key differences.\n\nOne of them is Charlotte, born a princess and later becoming the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. The other is Sophia, a native of Ukrainian Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Charlotte, always in the public eye, was a global figure until the end of her life. In contrast, Sophia, despite being born into a wealthy and influential Lviv family and raised in Ukrainian traditions, avoided publicity for most of her life. Yet, history has a way of illuminating even the most shadowed corners.\n\n',

				'The crossing perspectives of the histories of the countries where these two women lived deserve special attention. Common intersections include the long struggles for independence, territorial losses, debates over governance, linguistic issues, periods of occupation, resistance against enslavement, and collaborationism. Both countries also experienced the creation of myths around notable historical figures.\n\nFor a long time, Ukraine was an unknown country, obscured by the totalitarian Soviet regime. Even after independence, its history remained largely unnoticed in the European context. Luxembourg, on the other hand, was open to the world but unknown to Ukraine. Today, this situation has changed: Ukraine is now recognized globally, and Ukrainians are learning more about Luxembourg while experiencing its strong support.\n\n',

				"Luxembourg's history shares parallels with Ukraine's. For instance, Duke Adolphe's brief marriage to a Russian princess nearly cost his descendants the throne. Both countries faced cultural expansion from their neighbors but preserved folk traditions and languages. Luxembourg remained deeply agrarian for much of its history and fought hard for its independence. It emerged as a modern state at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, with its borders finalized in 1839 after the Belgian Revolution. The German occupation during both world wars tested the nation, but its resistance movement demonstrated a strong spirit of defiance. The words of the national anthem, 'Ons Heemet' (Our Fatherland), reflect this spirit: 'Let the sun of freedom shine.'\n\nUkraine's history, by contrast, is a tale of nearly continuous struggle—for land, freedom, language, faith, autonomy, and independence. Often deprived of statehood, divided among neighboring empires, and subjected to brutal regimes, Ukrainians have endured Mongol-Tatar invasions, Russian imperial serfdom, exploitation under the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Nazi atrocities during World War II, and genocide under the Soviet totalitarian regime.\n\nShort periods of hard-won independence serve as guiding lights in Ukraine's history, inspiring new generations of patriots. Known for their hard work, sincerity, and hospitality, Ukrainians have also become renowned for their will to freedom and resilience against oppression.\n\n"

Her research interests include education, women's education, gender history, regional history and the history of everyday life. \n\nHer interest in the relations between Luxembourg and Ukraine in the 20th century led her to initiate a research project on a well-known Ukrainian couple living in exile in Luxembourg and to shed light on their activities and networks, especially from Fedak's perspective."
