				'The war that Russia started against Ukraine in 2014 became a challenge for all European countries. Countries that were not directly affected by the aggression faced a powerful wave of migrants from Ukraine fleeing the war. This was a unique and further test for the democratic institutions of these countries. In particular, Luxembourg, with its traditions of relatively peaceful interactions between different cultures, has hospitably welcomed thousands of new migrants from Ukraine, a country unfamiliar to most of its residents. However, these interactions are not always free of conflict. [^cefisStudy]\n\nIt is worth noting that for the vast majority of Ukrainians, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has also been a kind of terra incognita until now. In this regard, we felt a need to introduce Ukrainians to Luxembourg society through the prism of historical events. It wants to highlight the attention of Ukrainian society to the historical traditions of Luxembourg’s support of political migrants and refugees, including those from Ukraine.\n\nThis project, as an act of memorialization, aims to honor women who dedicated their lives to a noble cause – serving their people, overcoming difficulties and supporting their families. The project focuses on two women from different countries, representatives of the same generation that survived two world wars. Let us retrace their life stories against the backdrop of global historical events, to draw parallels and show key differences.\n\nOne is Charlotte of Nassau‑Weilburg, born a princess and later Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. The other is Sophia Fedak, originally from Ukrainian Galicia in the Austro‑Hungarian Empire and later living in exile in Luxembourg. At first sight, everything opposes them. Yet they have much in common. Charlotte was in the center of attention of a wide range of people from childhood and remained a public figure on a global scale until the end of her life. Sophia was fortunate enough to be born into a well‑known, influential, and wealthy Lviv family, raised in Ukrainian traditions by caring parents, but had to avoid excessive publicity for most of her life and retained this status even after her death. However, time often sheds light even on historical shadows.\n\nLet us cross perspectives of the countries where the two biographies unfolded. Though very different in terms of size, both countries are historically characterized by a situation at the crossroads of different spheres of influence, languages and political systems. The Duchy of Luxembourg was part of a composite monarchy ruled by the House of Luxembourg in the Middle Ages, then by the Habsburgs. It was part of the Holy Roman Empire but often coveted and conquered by France before gaining statehood in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna (in personal union with the Netherlands until 1890). [https://sip.gouvernement.lu/fr/publications/minist-etat/sip/brochure/a_propos/A_propos_Histoire.html]\n\nUkraine was the center of the medieval Rus but was later divided between Poland‑Lithuania and the Moscow‑centered Russian empire. In the nineteenth century strong independence and national language movements were emerging, contrary to Luxembourg, which became independent due to the decision of larger powers. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/20027443]\n\nIn the course of the twentieth century, both Ukrainian and Luxembourgish nation‑building occurred but in very different contexts: one within the framework (often resisting) of the Soviet Union, the other within a sovereign state, declared “perpetually neutral” in 1867, yet twice invaded by Germany. [https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/2052]\n\nWhen faced with an occupying power, people were torn between resistance, collaboration and the struggle to survive.\n\nFor a long time, Ukraine was virtually unknown in the West, closed off by the totalitarian Soviet regime. Even after gaining independence in 1991, historical research on Ukraine mostly did not go beyond its neighboring countries, remaining little known in the rest of Europe. Today, the situation has changed. Due to the war, Ukraine has become known all over the world. And Ukrainians are learning more about Luxembourg, feeling its strong support in various fields and at all levels every day.
